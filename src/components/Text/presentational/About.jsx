      <h2>About <cite>Mapping Inequality</cite></h2>
      <p><cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> was created through the collaboration of three teams at four universities.</p>
      <p>At the <a href='//dsl.richmond.edu'>University of Richmond's Digital Scholarship Lab</a>, <strong>Robert K. Nelson</strong> led the DSL team; he developed the application for <cite>Mapping Inequality</cite>, co-designed it, and contributed to its explanatory and interpretative text. <strong>Justin Madron</strong> managed the data and metadata for the project and <strong>Nathaniel Ayers</strong> co-designed the map. The DSL's student interns contributed an enormous amount of labor to georeferencing HOLC maps, creating polygons, and transcribing area descriptions. They are <strong>Katrina Hayes</strong>, <strong>Chloe McKinney</strong>, <strong>Leah Reistle</strong>, <strong>Anna Moorhead</strong>, <strong>Ava Clarke</strong>, <strong>Claire Tate</strong>, <strong>Charlie Sears</strong>, <strong>Rong Bao</strong>, <strong>Lily Calaycay</strong>, <strong>Beaumont Smith</strong>, <strong>Rebecca Tribble</strong>, <strong>Erica Ott</strong>, <strong>Barbie Savani</strong>, <strong>Radha Zanza</strong>, <strong>Zach Halaschak</strong>, <strong>Gavin Hosman</strong>, <strong>Stefan St. John</strong>, <strong>Donald Edmonds</strong>, <strong>Haley Fortner</strong>, <strong>Max Hoffman</strong>, <strong>Amanda Lineberry</strong>, <strong>Emily Landon</strong>, <strong>Caitlin Greene</strong>, <strong>Ashley Flanigan</strong>, <strong>Leah Reistle</strong>, <strong>Gabriella Schneider</strong>, <strong>Nat Berry</strong>, <strong>Paige Warner</strong>, and <strong>Patrick Kliebert </strong>.</p>
      <p>At Virginia Tech, assistant professor of history <strong>LaDale Winling</strong> led a team of graduate and undergraduate students who conducted research at the National Archives; georeferenced maps and created polygons; and transcribed area descriptions.  These included <strong>Mason Ailstock</strong>, <strong>Carmen Bolt</strong>, <strong>Victoria Fowler</strong>, <strong>Claire Gogan</strong>, <strong>Jordan Hill</strong>, <strong>Andrea Ledesma</strong>, <strong>Rachel Snyder</strong>, <strong>Sydney Vaile</strong>, and <strong>Rebecca Williams</strong>, along with students in two classes.  Winling is an urban and digital historian. He is the author of<cite>Building the Ivory Tower</cite>.</p>
      <p>At the University of Maryland, professor <strong>Richard Marciano</strong> from the Digital Curation Innovation Center (DCIC) at the College of Information Studies ("Maryland's iSchool"), has led an extended team of students, with leadership from <strong>Greg Jansen</strong>, <strong>Myeong Lee</strong>, <strong>Sohan Shah</strong>, and <strong>Mary Kending</strong>. The group has engaged in a variety of processes treatments including: identification and digitization of historical maps and Area Descriptions from the National Archives, crowdsourcing and transcribing of the Area Descriptions, development of a NYPL Scribe-enhanced crowdsourcing platform, georeferencing of historical maps, design and testing of database models, sand developing of a Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning of transcribed Area Descriptions.  Students have included: <strong>Sarah Agarrat</strong>, <strong>Maddie Allen</strong>, <strong>Moreno Almirón</strong>, <strong>Mayuresh Amdekar</strong>, <strong>Nicholas Archer</strong>, <strong>Rahul Bahadur</strong>, <strong>Richard Bool</strong>, <strong>Sandy Bostian</strong>, <strong>Morgan Castle</strong>, <strong>Neha Chanchiani</strong>, <strong>Riya Chanduka</strong>, <strong>Jhon Dela Cruz</strong>, <strong>Shaina Destine</strong>, <strong>Emmanuel Dixon</strong>, <strong>David Durden</strong>, <strong>Erin Durham</strong>, <strong>Karishma Arun Ghiya</strong>, <strong>Edgar Guerrero</strong>, <strong>Shriya Gupta</strong>, <strong>Rosemary Hall</strong>, <strong>Kevin Hansen</strong>, <strong>Scott Harkless</strong>, <strong>Stephanie Harry</strong>, <strong>Hyeong-Gi Hong</strong>, <strong>Alec Jaensch</strong>, <strong>Lindsay Johnson</strong>, <strong>Sarah Jones</strong>, <strong>Anushka Uday Kher</strong>, <strong>Justin Kim</strong>, <strong>Karina Kletscher</strong>, <strong>Clare Kuntz</strong>, <strong>Ramleen Lamba</strong>, <strong>Pingchuan Ma</strong>, <strong>Helen McNamara</strong>, <strong>Martin Moreno</strong>, <strong>Anna Mulli</strong>, <strong>Shishiri Nganyone</strong>, <strong>Martin Nikolas</strong>, <strong>Okeze Nwofor</strong>, <strong>Dawit Ocbai</strong>, <strong>Oluwaseyi Oni</strong>, <strong>Reggie Padget</strong>, <strong>Lorenzo Pappas</strong>, <strong>Prasad Patwardhan</strong>, <strong>Jennifer Proctor</strong>, <strong>Neha Puthran</strong>, <strong>Deja Quintero</strong>, <strong>Darlene Reyes</strong>, <strong>Maya Riser-Kositsky</strong>, <strong>Azeez Saba</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Sagay</strong>, <strong>Lauren Schirle</strong>, <strong>Greg Schuler</strong>, <strong>Paige Searles</strong>, <strong>Neeraj Shirname</strong>, <strong>Jenny Siegel</strong>, <strong>Edel Spence</strong>, <strong>Marco Tanda</strong>, <strong>Will Thomas</strong>, <strong>Pujita Unmesh Tipnis</strong>, <strong>Chris Truong</strong>, <strong>Brandon Turp</strong>, <strong>Sydney Vaile</strong>, <strong>Priyanka Vengataraman</strong>, <strong>Namrata Walanj</strong>, <strong>Jennifer Wachtel</strong>, <strong>Zhaoxi Zhang</strong>, and <strong>Kai Zheng</strong>. This work builds on an earlier $250K IMLS-funded grant (LG-05-06-0158-06) called <a href='http://salt.umd.edu/T-RACES/'> T-RACES (Testbed for the Redlining Archives of California's Exclusionary Spaces)</a> with <strong>David Goldberg</strong> at UC Irvine and <strong>Chien-Yi Hou</strong> at UNC Chapel Hill, which digitized, georeferenced, vectorized, and made the neighborhood descriptions for all the cities of California searchable through an online database and mapping interface.  It also builds on a 2013 NSF/OCI Grant (0848296) called Cyberinfrastructure for Billions of Electronic Records (CI-BER), a cooperative agreement between NSF and NARA, with <strong>Cathy Davidson</strong> and <strong>Robert Calderbank</strong> at Duke.</p>
      <p><strong>N. D. B. Connolly</strong>, the Herbert Baxter Adams Associate Professor of History at the Johns Hopkins University and the author of <cite>A World More Concrete: Real Estate and the Remaking of Jim Crow South Florida</cite>, contributed his expertise in the history of race and urban America to the conceptualization and development of <cite>Mapping Inequality</cite>, particularly its textual elements.</p>
      <p>We would like to thank a number of individuals and groups. <strong>Bobby Allen</strong>, <strong>Pam Lach</strong>, and <strong>Claire Clements</strong> with Nelson and Marciano inventoried the HOLC files at the National Archives at College Park. We are grateful to a <strong>Jack A.Dougherty</strong>, <strong>Nathan Tauger</strong>, <strong>April De Simone</strong>, <strong>Eliot Tretter</strong> and <strong>David Pettegrew</strong> for sharing HOLC maps and area descriptions with us. Special thanks to <strong>Cathy Davidson</strong>, distinguished professor and director of the Futures Initiative and HASTAC@CUNY, for her team's support of T-RACES at Duke University with HASTAC Director of Social Networking, <strong>Sheryl Grant</strong>, which led to the expansion of the project to the cities of North Carolina and use in a Bass Connections "Information, Society, and Culture" interdisciplinary research theme with <strong>Robert Calderbank</strong> at Duke University and <strong>Molly Tamarkin</strong> (now Library Director at KAUST in Saudi Arabia), with the participation of Asheville community leader <strong>Priscilla Ndiaye</strong>, and students <strong>Rachel Anderson</strong>, <strong>Felicia Arriaga</strong>, <strong>Yue Dai</strong>, and <strong>Lalita Maraj</strong>. Great appreciation to <strong>Keith Pezzoli</strong>, director of the Urban Studies and Planning Program at UC San Diego, for years of early encouragement and championing of T-RACES through the USP program from 2000 to 2006.  That redlining work was first developed with <strong>Rosemarie McKeon</strong> and presented at the ESRI User Conference in San Diego in 1999 through a poster exhibit called "The Balkanization of Urban San Diego" and subsequently in 2000 as a touring art exhibit led by <strong>Rosemarie McKeon,</strong> called "Tolerance Zones",  with <strong>Carrol Waymon</strong>, <strong>Poyin Tse</strong>, and <strong>Midi Cox</strong>. Thanks as well to <strong>John Moeser</strong> who inspired <a href='http://dsl.richmond.edu/holc/'>"Redlining Richmond,"</a> an important antecedent to <cite>Mapping Inequality</cite>. Finally, <a href='//stamen.com/'>Stamen Design</a> developed the <a href='//github.com/americanpanorama/panorama'>Panorama toolkit</a>, components of which are used in <cite>Mapping Inequality</cite>. </p>
      <p>The <a href='//mellon.org'>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> provided the DSL generous funding to work on this and the other initial maps of <cite><a href='//dsl.richmond.edu/panorama'>American Panorama</a></cite>. The Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences also provided some funding for site development. <a href='https://www.mapbox.com/' target='_blank'>Mapbox</a> is generously providing the basemap tiles.</p>
