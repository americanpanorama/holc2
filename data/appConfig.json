Settlement of the what we now call the midwest was greatly accelerated by the construction of a network of artificial waterways in the first half of the nineteenth century. These canals also helped shape American regionalism, encouraging the emergence of the \"North\" by connecting the midwest to the northeast rather than to the South via the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.</p>",

			"intro": "<p><strong>Borrowed and modified from the 1920s-era \"concentric zones theory\" of Ernest W. Burgess, this diagram offers a view of how redlining concentrated populations, and did so along a generally consistent pattern.</strong></p><p>According to Burgess, every city developed as a series of concentric circles.  Downtown business districts would be followed by factory zones.  Factory zones would transition to slums, followed then by progressively more affluent housing for working people and the investor class, before then reaching the final zone, from whence commuters came into the city. As the historian Elaine Lewinnek points out, \"Burgess adapted a half-century of Chicago maps and codified them in a model of abstraction and urban theory that has been called&#8212;with some hyperbole&#8212;'the most famous diagram in social science.'\"</p><p>In Burgess's model, each ring had cultural and economic features&#8212;features that he explicitly associated with ethnic and racial populations. Poor whites and black migrants occupied central slum districts rife with vice dens and run down rooming houses and immigrant colonies.  Second-generation European immigrants and factory and a shop workers, \"skilled and thrifty,\" lived on the outer edge of the slums and on the inner edge of the ring of well-kept apartment houses and \"workingmen's homes.\" Beyond them was the \"Promised Land\" of residential hotels and single-family homes.  In contrast to the swarthy, congested slums, these were \"bright light areas\" safely protected by restrictive covenants and high price points.</p><p>Burgess's model, in addition to reflecting the homes of real estate investor communities, served as an extension of wider segregationist thinking driving both sociology as a discipline and administrative practice during the progressive era.  Obsession with cities as \"organisms\" of society, they believed in what the sociologist Louis Wirth benignly described as the \"eugenics of the city.\"</p><p>Many of the HOLC maps reflected both the categorical impulse and spatial organization of Burgess model with D and C neighborhoods more likely to be located around central business districts and A and B neighborhoods in increasingly suburban peripheries. The diagram visualizes the relative distribution of HOLC grades in relation to the center of the city. The opacity of the rings reflects the relative density of zoned areas on the map. Hovering over the rings will highlight areas for that grade.</p>",

		"<p><cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> updates the study of New Deal America, the federal government, housing, and inequality for the twenty-first century. It offers unprecedented online access to the national collection of \"security maps\" and area descriptions produced between 1935 and 1940 by one of the New Deal's most important agencies, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation or HOLC (pronounced \"holk\"). </p>",
		"<p>HOLC recruited mortgage lenders, developers, and real estate appraisers in nearly 250 cities to create maps that color-coded credit worthiness and risk on neighborhood and metropolitan levels. These maps and their accompanying documentation helped set the rules for nearly a century of real estate practice. They have also served as critical evidence in countless urban studies in the fields of history, sociology, economics, and law.  Indeed, more than a half-century of research has shown housing to be for the twentieth century what slavery was to the antebellum period, namely the broad foundation of both American prosperity and racial inequality.  Through offering a digital library of the state's role in housing development, Mapping Inequality illustrates vividly the interplay between racism, administrative culture, economics, and the built environment.</p>",
		"<p><cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> introduces viewers to the records of the Home Owners Loan Corporation with accessibility and on a scale that is unprecedented. Visitors can browse over two-hundred interactive maps and get a view of Depression-era America as developers, realtors, tax assessors, and surveyors saw it&#8212;a set of interlocking color-lines, racial groups, and environmental risks.  They can also use the maps and area descriptions to draw connections between past state actions (and inactions) and contemporary American problems.</p>",
		"<h3>Archiving Inequality for the Digital Age</h3>",
		"<p>Like so many other government agencies during the New Deal, HOLC and its parent bureau, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, shaped Americans' lives and livelihoods profoundly during and after the Great Depression of the 1930s. Both proved critical to protecting and expanding home ownership, to standardizing lending practices, and to encouraging residential and commercial real estate investment in a flagging economy.  Across the middle third of the twentieth century, arguably the most prosperous decades in American history, these agencies worked with public and private sector partners to create millions of jobs and help millions of Americans buy or keep their homes. At the very same time, federal housing programs helped codify and expand practices of racial and class segregation.  They ensured, moreover, that rampant real estate speculation and environmental degradation would accompany America's remarkable economic recovery and growth.</p>",
		"<p><cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> brings one of the country's most important archives to the public.  HOLC's documents contain a wealth of information about how government officials, lenders, and real estate interests surveyed and ensured the economic health of American cities.  And with the help of ongoing research, we continue to learn at what cost such measures were realized.</p>",
		"<p>Over the last thirty years especially, scholars have characterized HOLC's property assessment and risk management practices, as well as those of the Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration, and US. Housing Authority, as some of the most important factors in preserving racial segregation, intergenerational poverty, and the continued wealth gap between white Americans and most other groups in the U.S.  Many of these agencies operated under the influence of powerful real estate lobbies or wrote their policies steeped in what were, at the time, widespread assumptions about the profitability of racial segregation and the residential incompatibility of certain racial and ethnic groups.  Through HOLC, in particular, real estate appraisers used the apparent racial and cultural value of a community to determine its economic value.  <cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> offers a window into the New Deal era housing policies that helped set the course for contemporary America. This project provides visitors with a new view, and perhaps even a new language, for describing the relationship between wealth and poverty in America.</p>",
