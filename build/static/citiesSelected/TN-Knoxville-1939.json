fairly uniform in style throughout the area. It is rolling to hilly, about 60% improved. Schools are located on both east and west side of area and are convenient to entire area. Transportation is by gasoline bus along Broadway with shuttle bus along Washington Avenue through southeastern part. Broadway is a wide thoroughfare, the main artery to Fountain City and carries a heavy load of traffic. It is dotted with stores, filling stations, sandwich shops, tourist homes, some nice private homes and two nice large apartment houses.     The northeast corner, the eastern side between areas B-7 and B-9, and the western side beyond area B-8 are sparsely developed. It is an area of spotted improvements, some good, some bad and some indifferent. As a whole properties are fairly well maintained.

Airport adjoining on East has practically been abandoned since construction of new airport and is now being used by the National Guard.     Distance to city, lack of adequate transportation, distance to schools and cheaper construction make this a third grade area.","9":{"1":"Knoxville, Tenn.","2":"3rd","3":"C-1","4":"11-1-39"},"10":""}},"B2":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-83.9831,35.9454],[-83.9821,35.9437],[-83.9895,35.9392],[-83.9898,35.9401],[-83.9892,35.9421],[-83.9886,35.9437],[-83.9883,35.9451],[-83.988,35.9467],[-83.9879,35.9478],[-83.9876,35.9486],[-83.9866,35.9494],[-83.9853,35.9499],[-83.9847,35.9498],[-83.9842,35.949],[-83.9841,35.9482],[-83.984,35.9474],[-83.9836,35.9466],[-83.9831,35.9454]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-83.9831,35.9454],[-83.9821,35.9437],[-83.9895,35.9392],[-83.9898,35.9401],[-83.9892,35.9421],[-83.9886,35.9437],[-83.9883,35.9451],[-83.988,35.9467],[-83.9879,35.9478],[-83.9876,35.9486],[-83.9866,35.9494],[-83.9853,35.9499],[-83.9847,35.9498],[-83.9842,35.949],[-83.9841,35.9482],[-83.984,35.9474],[-83.9836,35.9466],[-83.9831,35.9454]]]]},"labelCoords":[35.944674218749995,-83.98564921875],"center":[35.945,-83.986],"boundingBox":[[35.939,-83.99],[35.95,-83.982]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.163,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Knoxville/1939/full-size/B2.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Knoxville/1939/B2/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Knoxville/1939/B2/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Knoxville/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"-"},"b":"Business & professional men, white collar workers","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"50","2":"50","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"n":{"5":"0"},"m":{"4":"0"},"l":{"2":"45-60"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Fair"},"i":{"5":"0"},"h":{"4":"0"},"g":{"2":"5500-7500"},"f":{"2":"90%"},"e":{"2":"100%"},"d":{"2":"Good"},"c":{"2":"7 years"},"b":{"2":"Frame & brick"},"a":{"2":"1 & 2 story singles 6/7 rm"}},"3":{"1":"15","2":"$4000-7500","3":"Readily"},"4":{"b":"-","a":"0"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"-","a":"0"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"9","2":"15.30 outside, $41.80 inside city"},"8":"This area is known as \"Forrest Hills\".

Lots are large, improvements are uniform in style and architecture and are well maintained, population is of the substantial type and popularity of the area is indicated by the volume of now construction in past two years.     Jump in grade, from first to third for area just south, is explained by the fact that there is a strip of vacant territory about 2 blocks wide between the two areas and the property fronting on Tazewell Road is adversely affected by encroaching business, filling stations, etc.","9":{"1":"Fountain City, Knoxville, Tenn.","2":"1st","3":"A-2","4":"10-27-39"},"10":""}},"C8":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-83.9234,36.0244],[-83.9227,36.0272],[-83.9223,36.028],[-83.9222,36.0307],[-83.9189,36.0317],[-83.9158,36.0347],[-83.9154,36.0356],[-83.9148,36.0351],[-83.9145,36.0346],[-83.9168,36.0325],[-83.9154,36.0306],[-83.9155,36.0299],[-83.9166,36.0289],[-83.9187,36.0274],[-83.9204,36.0265],[-83.9214,36.0247],[-83.9218,36.024],[-83.9224,36.0239],[-83.9234,36.0244]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-83.9234,36.0244],[-83.9227,36.0272],[-83.9223,36.028],[-83.9222,36.0307],[-83.9189,36.0317],[-83.9158,36.0347],[-83.9154,36.0356],[-83.9148,36.0351],[-83.9145,36.0346],[-83.9168,36.0325],[-83.9154,36.0306],[-83.9155,36.0299],[-83.9166,36.0289],[-83.9187,36.0274],[-83.9204,36.0265],[-83.9214,36.0247],[-83.9218,36.024],[-83.9224,36.0239],[-83.9234,36.0244]]]]},"labelCoords":[36.02911484375,-83.91999296874998],"center":[36.029,-83.919],"boundingBox":[[36.024,-83.923],[36.036,-83.915]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.14,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Knoxville/1939/full-size/C8.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Knoxville/1939/C8/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Knoxville/1939/C8/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Knoxville/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"-"},"b":"Low income wage earners of various kinds","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"100","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"f":{"1":"50%"},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""},"g":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"0","3":"0"},"4":{"b":"-","a":"0"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"-","a":"0"},"6":"Very limited","7":{"1":"9","2":"15.30"},"8":"This is an area about 25% improved, lying outside city limits.
