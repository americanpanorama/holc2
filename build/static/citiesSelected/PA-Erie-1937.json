This is in spite of the fact that most of the beach front and practically all of the portion of the area west of Delancey Place is zoned as \"A\" residence. In addition the lower part of the \"Newton Tract\" is restricted by deed. Since this area was the most desirable on the island prior to the development of Ventnor and Margate, it follows that there are many homes of very large size -some of comparatively substantial age- and others of thoroughly modern vintage. The combination of generally falling prices and deteriorating neighborhood gives these houses a present-day sales value of only small fractions of former cost- probably as low as 25% to 35%. Only two blocks between Atlantic Ave. and the Boardwalk are undesirable - the west side of Columbia and Bartram and Kingston Sts. These are old houses of unattractive type crowded closely together, and useful only as rooming houses (which use is prohibited by restrictions). Recent sales of these have been made as low as $2,000. The Wanamaker family formerly owned a very large mansion fronting of Ventnor Ave. and occupying the of a large city block. Failing in efforts to sell it for any reasonable consideration, the house has been demolished.

This low cost housing project is a direct cause of the good part of the recent sales activity in this area since it is causing a number of Italians who have been ousted to move farther west. The presence of a Catholic School on Texas Ave. helps to hold them in this immediate neighborhood. The farther west one goes in this section the better the values are, both because some older residents of different type are still hanging on and because th Italians of larger incomes are concentrating there.
