There is a decided mixture both as to size and desirability prevailing throughout with some above and others below the general average. Both Seneca Parkway and Maplewood Ave. are distinctly better and here values run as high as $10,000. On Lake Avenue there are a number of very large and very old homes, once beautiful but having a present worth that is questionable. In the main, dwellings are set back from streets that are nicely treed and located on fairly large plottage. Grounds are well kept and there is a good pride of ownership are convenient. Transportation is good. The future does not look too bright but any downward transition should be slow.

The eastern edge ends abruptly in a steep bank descending to a beautiful park. Despite the inconvenience of its location, its natural attractiveness lends itself to excellent development. One developer tried this in a grandiose manner. He chose the entire northwest corner, laid out fine wide and winding streets but built only about 15 large and fine houses before the whole proposition blow up. This year there have been two small developments (one on Landing Road, the other on Blossom Road) of very attractive modest sized homes. The balance of the area is spotted unfortunately with unattractive and rather old houses. All told, not more than 10% of the land is improved with an indicated future of eventually becoming a first grade area. There are all city facilities and schools. Neighborhood stores are nearby. There are no churches and special assessments are high.

Those on the side streets are somewhat smaller and the plots not quite so big but, in properties which, within the city limits suffer from high taxes. All city facilities are present. Schools, churches and stores are nearby. Transportation is poor and the area is some distance out but everyone uses their own car. The section is only about 60% improved and, being in the line of expansion, will probably continue to improve.","9":{"1":"East Avenue, Brighton & Rochester","2":"High 1st","3":"A-8","4":"11/1/39"},"10":""}},"B16":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-77.5219,43.1203],[-77.5198,43.1215],[-77.5128,43.1156],[-77.5129,43.1115],[-77.514,43.1106],[-77.5144,43.1105],[-77.5154,43.1099],[-77.5158,43.1092],[-77.5159,43.1084],[-77.5161,43.1079],[-77.5165,43.1077],[-77.5175,43.1076],[-77.5187,43.1078],[-77.52,43.108],[-77.5203,43.1086],[-77.5204,43.1092],[-77.5204,43.1096],[-77.5202,43.1101],[-77.5203,43.1107],[-77.5208,43.1107],[-77.5218,43.111],[-77.5224,43.1111],[-77.5231,43.1115],[-77.5232,43.112],[-77.5233,43.1128],[-77.5236,43.1133],[-77.524,43.1136],[-77.5245,43.1139],[-77.5252,43.1143],[-77.5255,43.1149],[-77.5257,43.1153],[-77.5257,43.1188],[-77.5254,43.1201],[-77.5222,43.1201],[-77.5219,43.1203]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-77.5219,43.1203],[-77.5198,43.1215],[-77.5128,43.1156],[-77.5129,43.1115],[-77.514,43.1106],[-77.5144,43.1105],[-77.5154,43.1099],[-77.5158,43.1092],[-77.5159,43.1084],[-77.5161,43.1079],[-77.5165,43.1077],[-77.5175,43.1076],[-77.5187,43.1078],[-77.52,43.108],[-77.5203,43.1086],[-77.5204,43.1092],[-77.5204,43.1096],[-77.5202,43.1101],[-77.5203,43.1107],[-77.5208,43.1107],[-77.5218,43.111],[-77.5224,43.1111],[-77.5231,43.1115],[-77.5232,43.112],[-77.5233,43.1128],[-77.5236,43.1133],[-77.524,43.1136],[-77.5245,43.1139],[-77.5252,43.1143],[-77.5255,43.1149],[-77.5257,43.1153],[-77.5257,43.1188],[-77.5254,43.1201],[-77.5222,43.1201],[-77.5219,43.1203]]]]},"labelCoords":[43.115158593749996,-77.51935078125],"center":[43.115,-77.519],"boundingBox":[[43.108,-77.526],[43.121,-77.513]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.404,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/NY/Rochester/1935/full-size/B16.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/NY/Rochester/1935/B16/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/NY/Rochester/1935/B16/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/NY/Rochester/1935/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":false},"C25":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-77.5267,43.1287],[-77.5267,43.1293],[-77.5267,43.13],[-77.525,43.1298],[-77.5219,43.1294],[-77.522,43.1246],[-77.5231,43.1247],[-77.5249,43.1263],[-77.5247,43.1286],[-77.5267,43.1287]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-77.5267,43.1287],[-77.5267,43.1293],[-77.5267,43.13],[-77.525,43.1298],[-77.5219,43.1294],[-77.522,43.1246],[-77.5231,43.1247],[-77.5249,43.1263],[-77.5247,43.1286],[-77.5267,43.1287]]]]},"labelCoords":[43.127300000000005,-77.52340000000002],"center":[43.128,-77.524],"boundingBox":[[43.125,-77.527],[43.13,-77.522]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.052,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/NY/Rochester/1935/full-size/C25.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/NY/Rochester/1935/C25/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/NY/Rochester/1935/C25/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/NY/Rochester/1935/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":""},"b":"Laborers & factory workers with incomes of $1200-1800","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"100","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"0","a":"1 at $8, 256"},"5":{"1":"3","b":"0","a":"0"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"9","2":"13.07, Effective Tax Rate for all C areas in Brighton based on 5 sales $16.08"},"8":"This is a small outlying and spottily developing section which is off the beaten track.

Homes, primarily built for summer occupancy, are of fair to large size and of more than pleasing architecture. Grounds, for the most part, are spacious and well-landscaped, evidencing excellent pride of ownership. In that portion of the area which lies in Greece, dwellings are newer and even more attractive, but bear high special assessments, though the neighborhood parks, stores, churches and schools, all are nearby. The land is slightly rolling; the streets are winding and shaded. Primary drawback is that there is scarcely any market for these properties which have all been built to order by the wealthy at costs of $30,000 and more. Occassionally, a lot sells for $5,000-$6,000. Future of the area is probably static.","9":{"1":"Shore Front, Greece & Rochester","2":"1st","3":"A-1","4":"11/1/39"},"10":""}}}}}
