consists of four subdivisions as follows: BROOKWOOD (north of Lake Shore Blvd.); FULLERWOOD (south of Lake Shore Blvd. to Forestview); HOMESITE (Forestview south to Shoreview) and FOREST PARK (Shoreview and area south - shown unplatted). BROOKWOOD was platted about 1924-25. Utilities and paving installed about 1928. Building was heaviest during 1929. An unusual situation in this area is the fact that expensive homes are intermingled with a few cheap homes (as low as $3000) constructed prior to platting and restrictions now in effect, namely: $6000 on side streets and $10,000 on lake front (exclusive of lot). Average lot is 50 ft. x 170 ft.; all streets improved. The presence of less desirable homes does not appear to detrimentally affect property value since their removal will eventually be accomplished. No additions being permitted. FULLERWOOD was platted about 1928 into lots 50 ft. x 158 ft. All streets have utilities installed. Only 25 homes are located in this beautiful wooded section. Lots originally sold for $60-$75 per front foot. Minimum restriction for homes (exclusive of lot) is $6500. Homes built are much more expensive. Development has been slow in this area due to rather high special assessments which, however, pay out this year. Lthough only 5% built up, the existing restrictions and beautiful appearance of this part of area will, undoubtedly, become a first grade neighborhood when development becomes substantial. HOMESITE was platted about 1924-25 into 40 ft. x 140 ft. restricted to $5000 (house and lot) and has the older homes in this whole area. However, new construction has been better than restrictions but lack of uniformity in set-back has damaged the appearance of some streets, particularly along E. 265th. Location of schools in this area holds property value. Although most homes are frame, new construction is primarily brick. Area is also beautifully wooded. FOREST PARK, a small subdivision, is entirely new and at present consists of 18 homes built last year ranging in price from $6750 to $7950. Construction is excellent; homes are predominantly of brick, gas heated and restrictions are strongly enforced by developer who intends to build 40 more houses on the two new streets being installed south of Shoreview bewteen E. 260th and E. 277th St. Price range of these homes will be from $6500 to $7500. On the whole, this area will maintain its general desirability due to the fact that beach privilaeges and actual home ownership are entirely dependent upon the approval of purchasers by other residents in community. This, in fact, is far more stringent than restrictions on home construction. Rentals are almost non-existent. The one detrimental feature to this neighborhood is its only fair transportation.

Development in the area from east boundary (east of E. 260th St.) along side streets is very light consisting of only a few scattered homes (most streets unpaved). However, along E. 250th (southern half) within the past three years considerable building activity has occurred sponsored by Moses Helper. Here large lots (mostly acre parcels) have been developed with homes ranging in value from $4500-$6500 (mostly frames mixed with an occasional brick structure). Sales have been good in this new development (10 built here last year). However, on the whole, this area suffers from lack of transportation, distance to schools, stores and churches. Nearest available transportation is half-hour bus service on Lake Shore Blvd. (northern boundary) and at intersection of Babbitt Road and Lakeland Boulevard (west of extreme southern part of area) 20 min. service. Upson Grade School for this district is located in northeastern part between Gilmore and Shoreview at E. 260th St. Future for this area appears favorable according to informed realtor's opinion but development will be moderate for the next few years because of lack of advantages mentioned before.","9":{"1":"Euclid","2":"3rd","3":"C-73","4":""},"10":""}},"D27":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.6648,-1.8585],[13.6649,-1.8595],[13.6589,-1.8661],[13.6581,-1.8654],[13.6573,-1.8643],[13.657,-1.8636],[13.6567,-1.8632],[13.656,-1.8634],[13.6558,-1.8627],[13.6536,-1.8633],[13.6532,-1.8612],[13.6643,-1.8584],[13.6648,-1.8585]]]]},"center":[41.587,-81.532],"boundingBox":[[41.583,-81.54],[41.589,-81.524]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.194,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/D27.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/D27/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/D27/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Recent movement of few colored families into neighborhood","d":"2 fam","c":{"2":"Yugo-Slavs"},"b":"Factory workers - laborers","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"95","2":"","n":{"4":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""},"p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"2","2":"$4000","3":"Owner built"},"4":{"b":"20","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"1","b":"10","a":""},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"8","2":"24.80"},"8":"This foreign section was developed about 25 yrs. ago with 1 to 1 1/2 sty. frame singles on 40' lots and almost wholly occupies by Yugo-Slavs who have kept gardens, chickens and some livestock (horses and cows) even today.

Other two family dwellings are scattered in the section north of Shaw but east of Hayden except that no \"two-families\" are located on Elmwood, Hampton and Shawview on this part. The low income of factory workers who predominantly occupy this area, has caused a rental situation here adverse to the holding of investment property. Loss of time and general unemployment (recent strike at Fisher Body Plant) has been a deterrent to a fair rental.

Shaker Square is a unique commercial development of attractive Colonial structures embracing all acilities. Area's high rental bracket (apts. particularly) and advantage of lying within the Shaker Hts. School District (no public schools in area) establishes its future as stable for the next several years.","9":{"1":"Cleveland (E. side) (Shaker Square Section)","2":"2nd","3":"B-35","4":""},"10":""}},"A19":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.6636,-1.9943],[13.6723,-1.9922],[13.6736,-1.9977],[13.665,-1.9999],[13.6636,-1.9943]]]]},"center":[41.454,-81.559],"boundingBox":[[41.451,-81.565],[41.457,-81.553]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"A","sqmi":0.247,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/A19.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/A19/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/A19/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"German-Czech-English"},"b":"Managers - Merchants - Skilled mechanics - Some professional","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"100","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"20","2":"Singles $8500","3":"Fair"},"4":{"b":"","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"8","2":"30.2"},"8":"This small section had its first development beginning with the dedication of streets in 1926 by the Rapid Transit Land Sales Co. later taken over by a Mr. Kleinman and recently actively developed (20 homes within past 12 mos.). Lots in this area are 40-45' wide; streets, arranged in rectangular form, are about 30% developed. Deed and zoning restrictions are rigid (price bracket $7500-$12,500) but lack of school facilities and distance to churches, shopping center and transportation (S. Moreland Blvd. Rapid Transit to the north) have resulted in considerable sales resistance, although half hour bus service may be obtained via Lee Rd. (western boundary). The major part of development to date has occured close to Lee. Rd. and future of area appears favorable but informed realtor's opinion is that top price bracket will decrease approximately 20% with the advent of additional construction until this will become an $8000-$10,000 neighborhood. Several families, in order to avail themselves of school facilities in Shaker Hts., now pay an additional tax for this purpose. It appears this area will remain first grade for the next several years, but will suffer a slight softening in prices, although desirability, from a residential standpoint, will improve with better transportation.","9":{"1":"Cleveland (Shaker- Lee Subdiv.)","2":"1st","3":"A-19","4":"10/10/39"},"10":""}},"B32":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.654,-2.0193],[13.6543,-2.0199],[13.6531,-2.0202],[13.6528,-2.0205],[13.6529,-2.021],[13.6532,-2.0217],[13.6528,-2.0221],[13.6517,-2.0227],[13.6509,-2.0237],[13.6506,-2.0247],[13.6491,-2.0244],[13.6481,-2.0211],[13.6449,-2.0218],[13.6429,-2.0149],[13.6498,-2.0132],[13.6525,-2.0126],[13.654,-2.0193]]]]},"center":[41.437,-81.591],"boundingBox":[[41.431,-81.598],[41.442,-81.585]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.403,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/B32.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/B32/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/B32/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"No - stable","d":"","c":{"2":"Polish - Bohemian"},"b":"White-collared office workers - Small business owners","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"95","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"9","2":"$7000-9000","3":"Owner-built"},"4":{"b":"35","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"1","b":"19-20","a":""},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"8","2":"23.40 (Cleveland Sch.

Although fairly level in the central part, the northwesterly corner is very scenic and the southern section (mostly undeveloped) is rolling and heavily wooded. This section was platted into 40 ft. x 130 ft. lots, with the exception of East Blvd. (west boundary), about 1921-23. All utilities are in and transportation on E. 131st St. is excellent and has attributed much to the growth of the area. Only a few streets in southern part of area along eastern border remain to be paved (sidewalks and curbs already in). The most expensive homes (approximately 25-30) are located along East Blvd. on 60-70 ft. front lots and range in price from $9000 to $14,000. Practically all of the new construction, during the past year, was on or near East Blvd. Calvary Cemetery, with its beautiful park-liek appearance abutting the west boundary, appears to have no detrimental effect on these East Blvd. property values. The retail district of this area lies along E. 131st St. Properties abutting this retail area, however, are uniform in desirability with balance of section. Owing to a peculiarity of school district allotment, this section, alothough within the limits of Garfield Heights, sends its children to Cleveland schools and thus pay a school tax of approximately $30 to $40 per property less than the effective Garfield Heights rate. This has enhanced the desirability of the area, particularly for rental tenancy as revealed by the fact that not one rental unit is available at present. Area is free from all normal detrimental influences, except for one odd situation. Colored residents from the distant fourth grade neighborhood to the southeast have acquired the habit of walking through the fields up to and along Christine Ave. in order to avail themselves of the high speed transportation on E. 131st St. This condition has created some sales resistance to properties on that street. This area is now approximately 75% built up and will retain its desirability. Speculative builders do not appear to be interested in this area since all but two of the nine homes built during the past year have been by owner-contract. ","9":{"1":"Garfield Hts.

Homes on Edgewater, Cliff, and Harborview range from $15,000-$25,000 and rent from $100-$125. Properties along Lake Ave. range from $12,000-$18,000 with a rental spread of $75-$90. The south side of Lake Ave., from West Blvd. extending all the way to W. 115th St., is built up with apartments. The rest of the area, however, is restricted to residences and the restrictions have some 20 more years to run. There are approximately 12-15 two-family homes in this area, located on Lake Ave. The area is free from exterior detrimental influences and remains very desirable due to its proximity to Cleveland's Public Square. Although sales are moving slow because of the age and the large type of homes, the area's occupancy continues to be very strong and, in all probability, it will remain so for many years to come. Professional men, especially doctors and attorneys, find this neighborhood desirable because of its nearness to the center of Cleveland. It has excellent transportation and the Edgewater Park bathing beach lies immediately east of this area. Its only handicap is the school situation; there are no junior or senior high schools and the nearest grade school (W. 105th and Baltic), which is located south of the area, stops at the 5th grade and children are compelled to go to the nearest full grade school which is about 1 to 1 1/2 miles away. However, informed realtor's opinion is that school handicap affects only a small portion of occupants (medium income bracket) for the majority of families send their children to private schools.","9":{"1":"Cleveland (W. side)","2":"2nd","3":"B-16","4":""},"10":""}},"B15":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.5084,-1.994],[13.5091,-1.997],[13.5082,-1.9971],[13.5081,-1.9977],[13.504,-1.9975],[13.5038,-1.9969],[13.5042,-1.9968],[13.5034,-1.9942],[13.5046,-1.9942],[13.5052,-1.9941],[13.5063,-1.9942],[13.5076,-1.9942],[13.5084,-1.994]]]]},"center":[41.491,-81.772],"boundingBox":[[41.489,-81.775],[41.493,-81.768]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.079,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/B15.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/B15/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/B15/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Very fine class of people locating in this area","d":"0","c":{"2":""},"b":"Professional - Executives - Business men","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"70","2":"30","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Fair"},"n":{"5":"0"},"m":{"4":"0"},"l":{"2":"50-150"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Slow"},"i":{"5":"0"},"h":{"4":"0"},"g":{"1":"7500-16,000"},"f":{"2":"-"},"e":{"2":"90%"},"d":{"2":"Good"},"c":{"2":"5-6 years"},"b":{"2":"Apartments (brick)"},"a":{"2":"Large and small"}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Available up to 50-60%","7":{"1":"8","2":"23.5"},"8":"This area is located in the extreme easterly end of Lakewood and fronts Lake Erie; entire area zoned for apartments some 15 years ago; older apartments located on Lake Avenue -- newer ones, along Edgewater Drive; no beach facilities due to high cliff; lots 60' x 180'.

In order to present a complete picture, we will take the entire area by footgae and explain its development beginning with E. 226th St. working east to the border of area at E. 265th. East 226th St. was developed in 1928 into lots averaging 50 ft. x 150 ft. at $45-$60 per front foot and is now about 50% developed with homes ranging from $7500-11,000. Fronting lake property (4 homes on Edgewater) range from $13,000-$18,000. Immediately east of this street are the estates of Carmi Thompson, Fred Hein, Chas. R. Ely, Ad Adams, Henry Guenther, Emma Smith and Herbert Gleitz. These properties lie on estate ground running from Lake Shore Blvd. 1400-1600 ft. deep to the lake and consist of 3-17 acre parcels and range in value from $50,000-$200,000. One parcel (Gleitz Estate) was purchased last year for $125,000. These exclusive estates are broken by the follong streets and driveways developed with shacks, summer cottages and semi-bungalow homes and a pumping station.

The area's building restrictions were mainly a \"street by street\" proposition and many portions without restrictions, such as those streets abutting the west side of Euclid Beach Park, and, Damon and Pythias resulted in a very shoddy small-lot development of cheap summer cottages and single homes many of which should be condemned as fire hazards.

Mortgage funds are ample in this part of area but are limited to a smaller percentage of the appraisal in the older parts of area to the south and west. Future for this 40% built up area is favorable in the eastern part but the older section will gradually decline and presence of amusement park and abutting cheap cottages will continue to be a detriment to the central part of the neighborhood.

This stable community should hold its own for several years, except in western part and along southern boundary which are declining slowly.","9":{"1":"Cleveland (E. side)","2":"2nd","3":"B-45","4":"9/22/39"},"10":""}},"D26":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.625,-1.8896],[13.6265,-1.8887],[13.6321,-1.8872],[13.632,-1.8863],[13.634,-1.8845],[13.6344,-1.8837],[13.6358,-1.8834],[13.6356,-1.8825],[13.6389,-1.8817],[13.6413,-1.8799],[13.644,-1.8776],[13.6457,-1.8759],[13.6463,-1.8766],[13.6478,-1.8753],[13.6479,-1.8747],[13.6478,-1.8741],[13.6472,-1.8735],[13.6462,-1.8727],[13.6463,-1.8715],[13.6468,-1.8707],[13.6475,-1.8702],[13.6478,-1.8699],[13.6475,-1.8686],[13.6484,-1.8694],[13.6495,-1.8704],[13.6502,-1.8714],[13.651,-1.8726],[13.6487,-1.8732],[13.6487,-1.874],[13.649,-1.8753],[13.6469,-1.8776],[13.6462,-1.8774],[13.6461,-1.8773],[13.6449,-1.8784],[13.6435,-1.8799],[13.6428,-1.8803],[13.6421,-1.8811],[13.6409,-1.8817],[13.6397,-1.8826],[13.639,-1.883],[13.6382,-1.8832],[13.6363,-1.8835],[13.6366,-1.8844],[13.6364,-1.8853],[13.6345,-1.8855],[13.6349,-1.8876],[13.6323,-1.8879],[13.6328,-1.8908],[13.6292,-1.8917],[13.6295,-1.8935],[13.6263,-1.8943],[13.6267,-1.8971],[13.622,-1.8987],[13.6218,-1.8986],[13.6214,-1.8965],[13.6233,-1.894],[13.6228,-1.8917],[13.625,-1.891],[13.625,-1.8896]]]]},"center":[41.569,-81.573],"boundingBox":[[41.559,-81.592],[41.583,-81.546]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.489,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/D26.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/D26/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/D26/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Slow infiltration of negro in western part","d":"5","c":{"2":"Yugo-Slav, Lithuanian, German"},"b":"Laborers - factory workers - some white collared","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"90","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"-","3":"-"},"4":{"b":"30","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"1","b":"10","a":""},"6":"Not available","7":{"1":"8","2":"30.20"},"8":"This 4th grade area (entire south boundary) abutting industrial and railroad property) was laid out 35-40 yrs. ago and developed with cheap single homes mixed with a few converted two-family structures ranging from 1-1 1/2 to 2 sty. dwellings.

Then about 1920 many residents (descendents of original owners) began moving to the exclusive Shaker Hts. and Gates Mills areas. *Rental of these properties (mostly frame), because of exorbitant maintenance, has been for only nominal rates to entice occupancy and, especially in the 12-15 rm. group runs as low as $40 per month. There is no market for these properties due to existing restrictions which prevent resubdivision for new home development. Owners of the largest parcels such as the Mathers, Cushings, Jordans and the Eddys still remain in this section. The possibility of lifting the restrictions to permit resubdivision is remote at the present time, therefore prices will continue downward for these large properties. The small southwesterly part of area (those streets south of Lake Shore Blvd.) is about 85% built up (40' front lots) with standard single homes intermingled with a few two families. These properties have had a fair sales market and good rental demand because of accessibility to downtown area via E. 105th St. public transportation.","9":{"1":"Bratenahl","2":"2nd","3":"B-44","4":"9/15/39"},"10":""}},"C56":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.613,-1.9115],[13.6133,-1.911],[13.6155,-1.9089],[13.6163,-1.9082],[13.6182,-1.9066],[13.6191,-1.9078],[13.6177,-1.9093],[13.617,-1.9098],[13.6178,-1.9113],[13.6218,-1.9101],[13.6249,-1.9131],[13.6254,-1.9131],[13.6263,-1.9181],[13.6277,-1.9263],[13.6277,-1.9271],[13.6249,-1.9279],[13.6244,-1.9277],[13.624,-1.9272],[13.6236,-1.9271],[13.6229,-1.9265],[13.622,-1.9255],[13.6213,-1.9254],[13.6211,-1.925],[13.6204,-1.9236],[13.6198,-1.923],[13.6182,-1.9227],[13.6162,-1.9221],[13.6158,-1.9217],[13.6153,-1.9188],[13.6143,-1.9173],[13.6139,-1.9166],[13.6146,-1.916],[13.6142,-1.9142],[13.6153,-1.9138],[13.6156,-1.9133],[13.6149,-1.913],[13.613,-1.9115]]]]},"center":[41.541,-81.599],"boundingBox":[[41.53,-81.608],[41.553,-81.592]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.808,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/C56.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/C56/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/C56/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Strong influx of Jewish-also spreading to north","d":"","c":{"2":"Jewish"},"b":"Small merchants - Tradesmen - White collared & skilled mechanics","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"60","2":"40","p":{"2":"Stable"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"n":{"5":"0"},"m":{"4":"0"},"h":{"2":"0"},"g":{"2":"5500-9000"},"d":{"2":"Fairly good"},"c":{"2":"25 years"},"b":{"2":"Frame"},"a":{"2":"2 family - 5-6 rooms"},"f":{"2":"65%"},"e":{"2":"99%"},"l":{"2":"27.50-45"},"k":{"2":"Stable"},"j":{"2":"Fairly good"},"i":{"5":"0"}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"-","3":"-"},"4":{"b":"25","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"1","b":"35","a":""},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"8","2":"30.20"},"8":"This third grade area's development varies considerably both in age and size of lots and structures.

Property values have remained stable since recovery from depression lows about 1935 and future trend appears favorable, although the probability of continued Jewish infiltration may have a detrimental effects. However, the location of Lutheran and Catholic churches in northern part will tend to arrest this infiltration due to their hold on property owners in their parish.

The area north of Euclid Ave. is developed with 20% single family and 80% 2-4 family and almost solidly of apartments between Doan and Taylor Rd. Commercial property is spotted along both sides of Euclid Ave. throughout the entire area but is concentrated heaviest between Lockwood and Fay, and, Stanwood and Richmond, and at Taylor Rd., and particularly, at Ivanhoe. This area has a rather large relief roll and also has a rapid fluctuation in vacancy ratio. The pressure of commercial growth detrimentally affects residential property abutting Euclid Ave. and the proximity to the Belt Line RR tracks has alwats been undesirable. Area about 98% built up. The influx of Italian occupants from the south, although slow, will eventually constitute a large percentage of the population and will, no doubt, continue more rapidly with age and obsolescence of property and its decreasing value. The older properties lie south of Euclid between Mt. Union and Noble Rd. However, the cheapest and oldest property lies in the small section north of Euclid between Fay and Holyoke. The general spottiness of development, age and obsolescence of property and growth of commercial district places this area in the slowly declining group. The northeast boundary of area abuts the large Nela Park industrial plants of General Electric Co- A large number of areas residents work here.","9":{"1":"E.

The ratio of singles and two-family homes varies on either side of St. Clair Ave., the main artery through this section. This ratio, north of St. Clair is 70% singles and 30% two-family and south of St. Clair is 60% singles and 40% two-family. Homes north of St. Clair range in age up to 45 years, the oldest of which were originally built without foundations and utilities and have since been remodeled. Properties south of St. Clair are considerably newer and range up to 30 yrs. with two families somewhat newer. Racial occupancy in this primarily industrial neighborhood also varies being almost solidly Italian south of St. Clair and East of Ivanhoe R. and heavily Slav north of St. Clair. Area suffered heavily during the depression, due to its predominancy of factory workers, and foreclosures were heavy. However, with the upturn in business during 1935-36 institutional sales on small down payment basis have been satisfactory. Property values in area have not recovered sharply because of the limited income of prospective purchasers who, through broken employment in such nearby industries as Fisher Body (abutting west boundary), New York Central Railroad Shop, Briggs and Apox Mfg. comapnies and various other industries, has not permitted the accumulation of more than a small down payment which prevents real estate transaction other than by institutions in liquidation. Example: Many of the 600 employees recently recalled to the Collinwoord Railroad shops, from a lay-off since July lived in this section. This fully built up industrial section will remain much the same for the next few years because of its advantageous location to nearby industries and transportation and occupancy desirability for the low income group. A slow infiltration of Italian may occur, although the area has had little shifting of population inside its boundaries.","9":{"1":"Cleveland (E side) (Formerly Collinwood)","2":"4th","3":"D-25","4":"9-15-39"},"10":""}},"C65":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.6694,-1.8729],[13.6694,-1.8732],[13.6691,-1.8737],[13.6688,-1.8743],[13.6684,-1.8746],[13.668,-1.8748],[13.6666,-1.8761],[13.6649,-1.8774],[13.6632,-1.8785],[13.6622,-1.8793],[13.662,-1.88],[13.6619,-1.8802],[13.6616,-1.8806],[13.6605,-1.8821],[13.6602,-1.8827],[13.6602,-1.883],[13.6609,-1.883],[13.6612,-1.8832],[13.6609,-1.8839],[13.6603,-1.8846],[13.6595,-1.8848],[13.6587,-1.8852],[13.6584,-1.886],[13.6589,-1.8868],[13.6592,-1.8876],[13.6586,-1.8879],[13.6575,-1.8895],[13.6573,-1.8898],[13.6567,-1.8909],[13.6556,-1.8924],[13.6555,-1.8929],[13.6552,-1.8928],[13.6543,-1.8924],[13.6533,-1.8918],[13.654,-1.8908],[13.6546,-1.8894],[13.654,-1.889],[13.6529,-1.8882],[13.652,-1.8878],[13.6512,-1.8873],[13.6506,-1.8871],[13.6529,-1.8842],[13.6568,-1.8866],[13.659,-1.8828],[13.658,-1.8823],[13.6563,-1.8812],[13.6553,-1.8807],[13.6565,-1.8794],[13.6567,-1.8791],[13.6576,-1.8795],[13.658,-1.8798],[13.6592,-1.8798],[13.6597,-1.8801],[13.6601,-1.8806],[13.6608,-1.8807],[13.6611,-1.8801],[13.6613,-1.8793],[13.661,-1.879],[13.6604,-1.8783],[13.6604,-1.8778],[13.6609,-1.8772],[13.6621,-1.8764],[13.6631,-1.8755],[13.6634,-1.876],[13.6638,-1.8765],[13.6643,-1.8764],[13.6649,-1.8759],[13.6647,-1.875],[13.664,-1.8741],[13.6634,-1.873],[13.6631,-1.8718],[13.6631,-1.8711],[13.6646,-1.8707],[13.6657,-1.8704],[13.6658,-1.8708],[13.6675,-1.8704],[13.6687,-1.87],[13.6688,-1.8707],[13.6689,-1.8713],[13.6692,-1.8723],[13.6694,-1.8729]]]]},"center":[41.568,-81.537],"boundingBox":[[41.557,-81.551],[41.577,-81.522]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.431,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/C65.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/C65/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/C65/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"a":{"2":""},"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":""},"b":"Factory workers - some white collared"},"2":{"1":"90","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"","3":"-"},"4":{"b":"10","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"1","b":"5","a":""},"6":"Available","7":{"1":"8","2":"24.80"},"8":"This third grade area is the outlying development along Euclid Ave. from E. 193rd to 228th St. abutting and between vacant industrial land and railroad property on its northern border.

Genessee and Shawnee Aves., is developed with singles - average age 15 yrs. - $3500-$5000; central part, containing E. 204th and Dillo Road, is mixed - has several two-family structures, principally on E. 204th St. - $5000-$6500; balance of area to the east is developed on side streets with singles - average age 30 yrs. $3000-$4500. Euclid Ave. contains scattered small commercial structures, gasoline stations, etc. and transportation on this highway is via street car (half hour service) but its terminus is at E. 212th St. and residents living beyond that part must walk to this point. Future for this 20% built up area is uncertain since its distance to downtown and only fair transportation, also proximity to railroad and industrial property, prevent giving it more than a weak 3rd grade rating.

Although restrictions throughout area have not been uniform, the original high price of lots apparently protected their development and has resulted in a remarkable homogeneity of construction although architecture varies. Schools, shopping centers and churches are located in the adjacent Euclid Ave. section. Some sales resistance is created by the fact that children from this area must cross Euclid Ave. to school. The rather steep hill from Euclid Ave. up to this plateau area is objectionable to housewives who must shop in Euclid Ave. section.

These apparently were over-improvements and later were taken over by Rockefeller and sold for approximately $20,000 to $22,000. Later development in this area, principally during 1938 and first half of 1939 consisted of 15 stone and frame homes ranging in price from $12,500 to $18,500.

This area has all desirable influences; lots average 60 ft. x 160 ft. - present lot sale prices approximate $2,200 (including all improvements and subterranean utilities) from street to house paid for.

Homes were first built along Glynn and Brewster costing from $22,500 to $45,000. Eighty-one of these houses were built during period from 1930-1931. Sale of same was halted by the depression (only three sold and the balance were put on a rental basis with such exclusive services as landscaping maintenance, police protection, private car transportation to stores and public transportation). Reappraisal of these properties, in 1936, placed them on the market within the bracket of $13,200 to $22,000 and sales were very satisfactory; mostly to tenants. Immediately following completion of this program, lots were placed on the market for sale for the first time but development was opened only one block at a time. Other construction to date, besides that of the Rockefeller interest, amounts to only three houses. At present the whole area is approximately 25% built-up (principally concentrated in the northern part along Glynn and Brewster and the north sides of Wyatt, Fenemore and Henley). This area has all desirable advantages and, with existing minimum building restrictions of $12,500, will continue to maintain its exclusive desirability. However, rapid construction in this area within the next 3 to 5 years is not anticipated due to the fact that Rockefeller interests are favoring the quicker development of the southern part of the allotment lying in Cleveland Heights due to transportation, stores and schools along Mayfield Rd. However, favored schools and their accessibility to this East Cleveland section of Forest Hills will hold all residents. According to the best informed opinion, present salable value of vacant lots in this area are bringing little, if any, more than the actual cost of installed utilities and improvements which are all subterranean, paid for, including those from street to house.","9":{"1":"East Cleveland (Forest Hills)","2":"1st","3":"A-29"}}},"A27":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.6673,-1.9353],[13.668,-1.9358],[13.6686,-1.9361],[13.6693,-1.9388],[13.6659,-1.9393],[13.6626,-1.94],[13.6589,-1.9408],[13.6567,-1.9309],[13.6557,-1.928],[13.6545,-1.9265],[13.6562,-1.9263],[13.6576,-1.9261],[13.6581,-1.9252],[13.6587,-1.9247],[13.6599,-1.9239],[13.6617,-1.9232],[13.6623,-1.9238],[13.6626,-1.9252],[13.6623,-1.9291],[13.6626,-1.9294],[13.6641,-1.9293],[13.6651,-1.9359],[13.6673,-1.9353]]]]},"center":[41.517,-81.55],"boundingBox":[[41.51,-81.557],[41.527,-81.541]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"A","sqmi":0.592,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/A27.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/A27/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/A27/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"c":{"2":"Jewish Extract"},"b":"Professional - Executive - Small Business Owners","a":{"3":""},"e":"Increasing Jewish occupancy of upper economic bracket.

The Heaton-Pennington Subdivision was laid out about 15 years ago, development began 12 years ago, and has proceeded steadily since that time. Sales were made principally to Jewish purchasers. Lots average 45-60 ft. frontage and originally sold for $50-$55 per front foot - now bring $25-$30 per foot. This part of area is now built up approximately 30% with harmonious, well restricted home development. New homes, principally, average $12,500 in price. The Severance Estate (lying to the north of the Heaton-Pennington Subdivision) at present has but two parts developed for lot sales (north side of Severn and west side of Crest Rds.). Balance of this area has been platted but not opened for development due to the fact that utility and pavement costs, plus ground value, as a highly restricted residential section, will not bring an equitable price in the present market. Sixty foot lots held at $2450 on Severn Rd. and $1850 on Crest Rd. are not finding ready takers. The Oak Ridge section (lying north of Mayfield Rd.) is an older and more expensive development than balance of this area to the south. Original development of expensive homes ranging in value up to $80,000 have suffered severely on the sales market due to the cheaper home developments surrounding this area. Informed realtor's opinion is that no property in this section will bring more than $30,000 as evidenced by recent sales. Four of the 19 new homes (last 12 mos.) built in area were located in this Oak Ridge Section. Lots average 60' x 150' frontage. New construction, in this 30% built up section, averages about $12,500 indicating that future development and values will stabilize at about this figure. No Jewish occupancy exists in the Oak Ridge section and, from best sources, it appears that future development of the Severance Estate will closely parallel its desirability with the nearby Rockefeller-Forest Hill development and the Oak Ridge section of this area.","9":{"1":"Cleveland Hts.

From 1920 death blows to this area's values were: encircling heavy foreign infiltration into abutting areas, principally Russian-Jewish into section to the northeast; and most important, the almost total migration of wealthy families in this area to the exclusive Shaker Heights subdivision between 1920-30. Then too, original restrictions to residential use on Wade allotments are at expiration point now. Virtually 90% of the original owners of these large homes have moved from this section. This has had a detrimental effect also on the market value of smaller single-family homes which are lcoated in the northerly portion of area. Because of the proximity of these large homes to the college buildings abutting south boundary, many of them have been converted into rooming houses, boarding houses and small educational institutions in themselves, such as: music schools, art schools and fraternity houses. At present it is estimated these fine homes, some costing $300,000, now bring 10¢ or less on the original dollar cost. Exorbitant maintenance prevents ready rental of these large homes but, in many cases, owners have made nominal leases for educational or institutional use. Properties in the northern part abutting the park do not follow in this latter class but because of their obsolescence, size, and large lots have been thrown into this category. Property values in area will, eventually, stabilize for the smaller single family homes with the absorption of large homes now on the market.

(Van Sweringen subsidary). Rigid deed restrictions were then affected setting the size of foundations to lot frontage as follows: 40' lot - 28' foundation; 45' lot - 33' foundation; 50' lot - 35' foundation (depth of foundation not to exceed width.) Corner lots having 7000 sq. ft. or more of space are zoned for duplex construction but for the most part are undeveloped. The exception of Northwood and Silsby Aves. (N.W. part) from these restrictions caused the formation of a Residents' Committee about 2 years ago which now must pass on all construction plans prior to approval by the Van Sweringen Co. thus placing a second rigid test on new construction. The present active pace of construction dates back to only 1935 but has continued to gain momentum since that time. John Carroll University is located in area, and also a golf course. Proximity of this area to Hathaway-Brown (private school for girls) is a strong selling point. Area has express bus service (22 min. to downtown) but lacks store facilities which are being planned for at the intersection of Warrensville and Fairmount Blvd. (center fo south boundary). Most expensive homes ($12,500-$16,500) are located principally east of Warrensville Rd. around the University grounds and also in S.W. part on Edgerton and Claridge. Future for this excellent neighborhood appears very favorable for the next 10-15 years. Five percent vacancy consists only of new constructions not yet occupied by owners or vacant-for-sale.

The westerly finger-like projection of Antisdale and Grosvenor is the older part of area; utilities in and streets improved and paid for; 50% built up with homes in the $6500-7500 bracket (avg. 7 years). The other projection in that westerly part indicates slight development on side streets (two-thirds paved) just off Warrensville Rd. The northwestern corner contains two streets, Genessee and Sherbrooke, developed with modern 2-family homes ($10,000 class). Balance of area developed with singles; Harold ($6500); Buxton ($5500-6500 bungalows); Bexley Park ($9000 brick singles). The blank portion between Warrensville and Renford Rds. is undeveloped and has lain dormant for 15 yrs. The part of area east of Renford Rds. to Green Rd. and south of Bayard contains the area's most expensive homes built about 12 yrs. ago ranging up to $30,000 but now bring $12,000-$15,000. Sale resistance due to lack of transportation and distance to stores, churches and schools (by bus) and principally due to the fact that part of this area consists of Torrenized Land (Acacia Dr., Langerdale and parts of Templehurst and Laurel Hill) involving several court suits for payment of assessments and taxes. The southeastern corner of area between Green and Lyndway south of Notre Dame (school for girls) contains only 6 houses ($8500 class) has lain dormant since the depression (deed restrictions unwarrantedly high). The portion of area north of Bayard between Renford and Green is mostly undeveloped, although streets are paved and utilities are in (15% built up with $6500-7500 bungalows and singles). The northeast corner of area (Maywood, Oakmont and Sheridan Sts.) had had very active building activity within the past 18 mos. (20 new homes in past 12 mos.) and sales have been very good here. This area's future will vary according to each small part as discussed above but informed realtor's opinion is that the northeastern portion between Green Rd. and east boundary south to Division will continue to be actively developed because of the attraction of its uniformity and proximity to schools, stores, churches and transportation on Mayfield Rd.

Almost immediately the commercial district along Kinsman became solidly Jewish-owned and a heavy infiltration of Russian-Jewish and Italian occurred between 1920-30 and although slower since then has continued up to date. Beginning with about 1928 a movement of colored from the downtown areas started in this section and progressed with moderate success up until about 3 years ago when the movement became more pronounced, and at present is continuing steadily. The heavy slump in price valuation in property in this area occurring following the depression made some recovery up to 1937 with improved general business conditions but is again sliding due to lack of maintenance and constant infiltration from these elements. A boom of commercial property along Kinsman Rd. was experienced in 1928 but collapsed and did not materially affect residential property values. This area throughout shows poor maintenance and rapid depreciation of property is characteristic of these inhabitants. Informed realtor's opinion is that this section should have been, at the outset, developed for colored occupancy as an overflow outlet for the dtrong movement that has progressed into the northeastern part of Cleveland. However no concerted effort was made and the present occupancy has resulted from the normal characteristic of colored infiltration into Jewish & Italian neighborhoods with the obsolescence of property due to lack of maintenance. The apparent future for this area will be an increasing occupancy ratio by Jewish, Italian and colored with a steady fall in price value.","9":{"1":"Cleveland (E. side) (Kinsman - Mt.

Occupancy here began with an extremely heavy infiltration of Russian-Jewish from the downtown 4th grade area around Woodland-55th between the years of 1920-30. The older 4th grade area lying to the west has steadily moved east into this section due to the colored encroachment in that 4th grade area, which also threatens this section although exclusion of Negro occupancy has been restricted to the 4th grade area as shown on map. The cheapness of construction has tended to increase the lack of property maintenance, also partly characteristic of the area. Lots in this area average 40' frontage and are developed about 70%. However, such streets as E. 147th & E. 149th are undeveloped except for the immediate vicinity of Kinsman (main thoroughfare and business center).

The portion of area north of Hough Ave. was formerly the district of business owners and high grade factory workers, which, due to age and infiltration, has now gained a heavy foreign occupancy. The large single homes and heavy development antedated the two family structure popularity so that at present only approximately 10% of the buildings are of the up-and-down 2-family type. This area also falls into two rental medium groups -- south of Hough Ave. rental medium is approximately $35-45; north of Hough rentals are $25-35. The area has gone rapidly to commercial structures along its main arteries such as: St. Clair, Superior, Wade Park, Hough and Euclid. The aoutheastern corner of area includes the largest shopping and commerical center east of the downtown business district at the intersection of E. 105th and Euclid. Stability of area, particularly southern part, depends primarily on its potential growth as the largest apartment section immediately east of the downtown area.

This section, fairly flat with very little wooded area, was formerly open farm land until platted about 1924-25 into lots averaging 40 ft. x 120 ft. and is now about 45-50% built up. Development was very rapid during 1926-27 but became dormant in 1929 and remained so virtually until spring of this year. However, new construction sales this year have been so favorable that several builders are seriously planning steady construction (one a week) in the southern portion west of Turney Rd. The most expensive homes are located along and near Edge Park Blvd. abutting Garfield Park and range in price from $6500 to $17,000. There are also about five homes on the north side of Garfield Blvd. between E. 94th & Turney Rd. and about ten homes on the Blvd. east of Turney Rd. averaging from $7500 to $15,000. Occupants of this area are principally desirable second and third generation of foreign descent who were raised in the older foreign sections such as the third and fourth grade areas around E. 65th & Fleet and E. 55th & Broadway. These inhabitants take great prode in their home ownership and are constantly improving the appearance of their homes. The retail area for this whole neighborhood is along Turney Rd., particularly between Parkview and Richland Avenues. All utilities are in and all streets are paved except a part of Grace Avenue. This area has no detrimental influences and should continue to grow into a more desirable community. Development primarily will be in the part west of Turney Rd. since it is only 25% built up while the section east of Turney Rd. and to the north is built up about 75%. Agent's personal inspection of new construction revealed that properties are very well built. For example: five room, one floor plan homes, with copper plumbing, modern bath and kitchen fixtures, gas heat, 40 ft. x 120 ft. lots, are reasonably priced at $5600 to $5900 and are mostly being sold prior to completion. Homes constructed in price range of about $6500 are mostly owner-contracted.

The section north of Turney Rd. is more sparsely developed and consists of better type homes than that portion south of Turney Rd. (Corkhill). The recent trend has been the abandonment of the cheap, cottage garage type homes partially die to condemnation by Maple Heights officials.

Majority of streets have sidewalks; all utilities available in area except for gas. Transportation is only fair- half hour schedule during rush, on the hour normal. This area, although near to railroad yards, does not suffer to a large extent from dirt and soot due to prevailing southwesterly winds.

Industrial property and railroads virtually surround this area except that part of southwesterly boundary abutting Washington Park. Most of the inhabitants here are employed by Republic, Otis, U.S. Steel and Aluminum Co. of America (abutting area.) The area is distinguished by its heavy concentration of 2-family homes, not located in any particular section but grouped in sets of 10-12 -- apparently built in rows by contractors. Several long one-floor plan singles (approx. 5% of total) have been converted into 2-family utility. Here and there pride of ownership is evident in inexpensive improvement, such as new lawns and upkeep of shrubbery but on the whole, limited income of these residents leaves much to be desired in renovation. The small commercial structures are scattered along thorofares of Broadway, Fleet, Aetna and Harvard. Area has good transportation, school and social centers, such as lodges and halls; two large Polish Catholic Churches are located in 3rd grade neighborhood surrounded by this area. Main shopping center for this district is located in 4th grade area to the north along Broadway. This fully built-up section, although old and detrimentally affected by smoke, soot, fumes and dirt, is stable due to the type of inhabitants, (Polish), high home ownership ratio and proximity of employment.

After 1929 area again lay dormant until within the last 18 mos. when new construction of single homes started (all owner-contracted).

The homes in this area are very old, and mostly without basements or furnaces (homes are heated with gas and circulating coal heaters). General upkeep and maintenance is very poor - some of the homes have not been painted since the depression.

The old residents moved to Lakewood, Rocky River and Bay Village. The area was developed generally with large single homes on 20-40' lots with a few 50' in width on Kenilworth Ave. The industrial and commercial expansion of the \"west side\" was keenly felt by this area. Now bordered by railroads, factories and steel mills on the north and east boundaries and traversed by 3 main heavy trafficked arteries (W. 25th-Scranton-W. 14th St.) this once fashionable and peaceful residential community rapidly gave ground to its inescapable transition. The fair residential parts or what is left of them lie in the southwest corner (west of W. 25th St.) and along Kenilworth in the north part of area; the poorest sections, along the eastern boundary. The large single homes are generally located on Scranton, W. 14th St., Kenilworth and Starkweather. Briefly, the area consists of: 40% large and small single homes, 40% two-family type (90% of which were converted doubles) and 20% three or more family unit dwellings; the latter type is crowded with two homes on one lot--5 homes on 3 lots, etc. Such streets as Vega, Jennings, Scranton, Walton and Seymour were once the area's most fashionable districts. Retail business-stores run solid on W. 25th and very heavy on Scranton and W. 14th Cleveland's Municipal Hospital (largest city hospital in country) is located on Scranton. One of Cleveland's five Govt. Slum Clearance Projects (500 families) is situated in eastern section of area. The Jennings Rd. Project (WPA) when completed, will relieve the heavy traffic congestion on W. 25th St. The area has a 10% vacancy with many uninhabitable units especially in the north-eastern section; vandalism prevails most strongly here. Rental collections are difficult and WPA and Relief Rolls are very heavy. Despite its undesirability, present type of occupants are not scarce in Cleveland and area's characteristics in the main will remain constant for several years.

The foreign-born people continue to come into this section at a slow but steady pace as the better native American people emigrade in about the same ratio. Some Negroes area also trickling into the southern part of area. Proximity to industry, railroad yards and Public Square will, undoubtedly, uphold the area's present level for a few years at least.

Originally settled by Germans and Irish, it slowly bowed to Cleveland's expansion and infiltration of other foreign peoples. Roumanians, Hungarians and Italians migrated here about 30 yrs. ago and now comprise the predominating population elements. The Roumanians settles around W. 48th St. district-- the Hungarian and Italian people located between W. 54th and W. 73rd Sts., (largely north of Detroit Ave.) Several old German families are still found along the eastern and central part of the area. The earliest developments of this area was along W. 28th and W. 29th Sts. and here many of the homes are 75 to 80 yrs. old; now fully developed, the area was built up with large 2 sty. single dwellings, many of which were converted into 2-3 family units and rooming houses; (there are a few 1 1/2 sty. homes on each street interspersed with the large converted type). The houses along W. 58th St. and west thereof are in better repair condition--are more modern--have full basements and average 25-30 yrs. Franklin Ave. was once the fashionable district of the west side; two family homes (with round basements) on this street sell for around $3500-$5500 singles and doubles without basements or round cellars from $1800-3500. The main business section of west-side Cleveland is located here; retail business shops run solidly along Lorain, Detroit, Fulton and W. 25th St. There was a small colored settlement in the northeast peak of this area but there homes were razed for the new Main Ave. bridge and also for the Slum Clearance Project. Proximity to Public Square and to industry and because of convenience to transportation, schools, stores, churches, etc. this area will remain attractive to present type of occupants. Transition is to retail stores, light manufacturing establishments and rooming houses.

Up until 12 years ago it was almost solidly occupied by Hungarian and Slovak population but with the lessening of industrial activity and lack of upkeep in dwellings, a steady movement of Hungarian families from this neighborhood brought an immediate infiltration of colored from the Outhwaite section lying to the northwest. This infiltration has continued, principally, along Kinsman in the northwestern part of area. At present, property values have virtually reached their maximum depreciation and sales are almost at a standstill except for speculative purposes by owners with purpose of renting to colored in mind for higher rental income. Responsibility for this change was hastened by the electrification of the New York Central RR lines, which in many cases made dead-end streets, and the closing of factories in the depression following '29. The general detriments caused by proximity to industry are all apparent and the lack of upkeep in property will continue to attract colored occupancy. The main thoroughfare for this district is Kinsman Rd. along which commercial property is scattered. The only possible improvement or change from the present rate of colored infiltration would be the renewal of industrial activity which would attract white factory workers back to this area thus creating a market for the sale of heavy institutional holdings. Social facilities are noticeably lacking in this area consisting of one grade school and one junior high and a few churches. Area is 99% built up.

Only nominal restrictions in some sections of area and none in others. As a result, the area was improved with cheap cottage type homes. J. S. Bradley Realty Co.

Sewer cannot be installed until a disposal plant is built somewhere in Rocky River valley. This was contemplated sometime in 1928 but never materialized. Lack of good transportation and utilities, stores, schools and churches and distance from center of town constitute the detrimental influences. No street lights, with exception of Rocky River Drive. Fifty percent of vacant lots are individually owned. These were bought when subdivision was laid out. Much of this land appears on tax delinquency list.

Twelve new homes built within past year along W. 226th and W. 227th. Very little development west of municipal limits. Many of the early owners located here, principally, because they could purchase large lots at low cost. As the area developed, several improvements were installed running up the special assessments to a high cost per lot with the result that a good number of the early owners were forced to give up their properties. In addition to these assessments there is a school tax of approximately $12.00 per year. The situation has been somewhat improved through the expiration of some of the special assessments and also because in later years a slightly 'higher-wage-earning class' had settled here.

The area is generally hilly and rolling and overlooks scenic Metropolitan Park which lies to the east. Olmsted Falls is one of the oldest villages in the county. It is built up 20% with all types of homes. There was a good bit of \"sentimental\" buying during the \"boom days\" in Cleveland and a particularly heavy demand for scenic spots where old homes were purchased and remade into \"colonial type residences\"; as a result, there are several fine old \"land marks\" in the area. The newer homes are located south of the village center and west of Columbia Rd. Most expensive homes ($12,000) located along River St. in the eastern (most scenic) section of the city; the cheapest homes (cottages arounf $2000-$2500) are found on the extreme west side on Cranage St., west of Division St. Three new houses built here during past 12 months. Area's retail shopping district consists of 6 stores; good grade and high school facilities. Lack of adequate transportation is area's chief deterrent (street car to Lorain & Rocky Rover Dr. and transfer to bus to Olmsted Falls (hourly). Train service - one round trip per day by N.Y.C. RR (22 minutes to Cleveland downtown). Main arteries are Columbia and Bagley Rds. Pending improvement in travel facilities, any progress in the area will be along conservative lines.

On the whole, however, and because of its age, location of quarry and present appearance, the area is accorded a weak third grade rating.","9":{"1":"Berea","2":"3rd","3":"C-3","4":"8/14/39"},"10":""}},"B27":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.4691,-2.1393],[13.4671,-2.1395],[13.4668,-2.1374],[13.4677,-2.1371],[13.4672,-2.1345],[13.4678,-2.1344],[13.4677,-2.1335],[13.4648,-2.1341],[13.4637,-2.1276],[13.4651,-2.1264],[13.4654,-2.1275],[13.4654,-2.1284],[13.4659,-2.1289],[13.4669,-2.1293],[13.468,-2.1294],[13.469,-2.1292],[13.4691,-2.1309],[13.4693,-2.1314],[13.47,-2.1318],[13.4699,-2.1321],[13.4684,-2.137],[13.4684,-2.137],[13.4687,-2.1384],[13.4688,-2.1384],[13.4689,-2.1388],[13.4691,-2.1393]]]]},"center":[41.367,-81.862],"boundingBox":[[41.36,-81.866],[41.373,-81.858]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.168,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/B27.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/B27/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/B27/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"","c":{"2":""},"b":"Professional - Business men - College Professors","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"98","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"5","2":"$5000-6000","3":"Good"},"4":{"b":"","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"8","2":"26.4"},"8":"This is a fairly new residential section.

About 8 to 10 two-family homes are located in the area. Lots range from 40-60 ft. frontageand average 120-150 ft. depth. Land value averages from $20 per front foot on unpaved streets to $30 per front foot on paved streets. Only 4 streets are unpaved in this area - W. 58th, W. 59th, W. 60th and W. 62nd (one being paved now).

The easterly section of area was platted in the warly 1920's and the westerly portion saw development  in the late 1920's. The area has all utilities installed and all streets paved, with the exception of W. 56th and W. 57th (south of Memphis); a small group of retail stores is concentrated at W. 48th and Memphis Ave. with a thin scattering on the \"numbered streets\" south of Memphis; convenient to schools and churches; transportation is by bus service on Memphis and W. 73rd - but transfer to street car is necessary to reach downtown. The single and two-family homes are intermingled, however the eastern half shows a predominance of two-family homes; new construction is concentrated along W. 56th and W. 57th on which streets some 15 new homes ($5200-6350) were erected within the past 12 months. Practically all of the unimproved lots are individually owned. The area will, in all likelihood, retain its present standard of desirability for several years due to proximity to Brookside (Zoological) Park and also because of its abuttment to first grade area (A-14). Likewise, construction of new bridge over Brookside Park has made this area more accessible and there has been a noticebale increase in demand since its construction. Some years ago the Representative Realty Co. had begun construction of many homes in this area and went broke leaving several \"skeletons\" standing in addition to about 50 completed new homes; the company's interests were purchased by the Sammon Investment Co. who, through a sound selling campaign, was successful in disposing of all but 6 of the properties. For instance, out of some 40 new homes located in W. 48th, the Sammon Co. sold 34 - each selling for a little over $7000 with a $500 down payment, balance by first bank loan and junior mortgage. It is noticeable that not one of the homes sold by Sammon Co. was foreclosed or taken back during the entire depression period. Institutional holdings in this area are below average at present.","9":{"1":"Cleveland (W. side) (formerly Brooklyn)","2":"2nd","3":"B-20","4":"9/28/39"},"10":""}},"C26":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.5814,-2.0472],[13.5812,-2.0465],[13.5816,-2.0459],[13.5796,-2.0366],[13.579,-2.0363],[13.5785,-2.034],[13.5717,-2.0357],[13.5709,-2.0356],[13.5696,-2.0372],[13.5712,-2.0382],[13.5717,-2.0405],[13.5668,-2.0418],[13.5657,-2.0421],[13.5656,-2.0417],[13.5503,-2.0451],[13.5498,-2.043],[13.5463,-2.0438],[13.5462,-2.0425],[13.5529,-2.041],[13.5528,-2.04],[13.5566,-2.0391],[13.5555,-2.0342],[13.5618,-2.0328],[13.5619,-2.0312],[13.5612,-2.0311],[13.5613,-2.0296],[13.5646,-2.0304],[13.566,-2.0308],[13.5665,-2.031],[13.5671,-2.0314],[13.5673,-2.032],[13.5675,-2.0322],[13.5708,-2.0315],[13.5706,-2.0303],[13.5729,-2.0294],[13.5725,-2.0279],[13.5724,-2.0267],[13.5755,-2.0254],[13.5764,-2.0254],[13.5772,-2.0266],[13.5783,-2.0272],[13.5794,-2.0277],[13.5814,-2.0298],[13.5808,-2.0363],[13.5825,-2.0447],[13.585,-2.0457],[13.5842,-2.0478],[13.5828,-2.0474],[13.5833,-2.0498],[13.5821,-2.0501],[13.5814,-2.0472]]]]},"center":[41.438,-81.703],"boundingBox":[[41.421,-81.733],[41.447,-81.683]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":1.373,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/C26.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/C26/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/C26/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Slow foreign infiltration from downtown west side","d":"0","c":{"2":"Cosmopolitan"},"b":"All types of middle class workers; some professional & small business owners","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"65","2":"30","p":{"2":"Firm to slightly up"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"n":{"5":"4"},"m":{"4":"-4"},"l":{"2":"25-40"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Good"},"i":{"5":"4"},"h":{"4":"-4"},"g":{"2":"4500-7500"},"f":{"2":"45%"},"e":{"2":"95%"},"d":{"2":"Fair"},"c":{"2":"18-20 years"},"b":{"2":"Frame"},"a":{"2":"2-family, 5 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"10","2":"$5000-6000","3":"Owner-contracted"},"4":{"b":"125","a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)"},"5":{"1":"1","b":"45","a":""},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"8","2":"30.20"},"8":"This medium old section is the original location of Brooklyn Village and first lay between Broadview and Pearl Rd. and later expanded along both sides of Pearl Rd. and, fairly recently, east of Broadview.

An additional drawback to this community is the absence of any local source of industrial employment; transportation to Cleveland industrial area (9 mi. distant) is only via combination morning and evening train service. School facilities consist of centralized grade and high school. In the past yrs., Solon has had little or no construction activity within this area but thoroughfares leading out of community have been developed with many cheap constructed small homes (36 in '38) some without basements. Zoning restrictions for the township, however, now prohibit this type of construction. Above mentioned heavy Village indebtedness resulted in many foreclosures. Over 100 of the approx. 400 dwelling structures changed hands between '28-'37 for this reason. Vacancy was also high, being estimated at 7% during '38 but now believed to be only about 3% due to low-rental housing demand in Metropolitan area. This community has had only negligible development except for the period between '18-'28 and due to the aforementioned factors will progress very slowly at best during the next few years. Area is accorded a weak 3rd grade rating.

The topography is rolling and slopes down to the Chagrin River which dissects the northern half of area. Development began here over 100 yrs. ago with the founding of the township, and has proceeded at a negligible rate, population approx. 3000. The commercial district is centered amd restricted to the triangle formed by the thoroughfares; Franklin, Washington and Main Sts. Residential development varies somewhat, but generally along thoroughfares consists of the intermingling of newer homes ranging from 15-75 yrs; many of the old homes have been extensively remodeled, some into doubles. Lot frontage varies from 45-80 ft.; area has very few 30-35 ft. front lots. The northerly part, along Cottage and High Sts., contains the cheapest development; avg. age 65 yrs., price bracket $2500-$3500. The newer sections, active 1925-29, along such streets as Olive and Hall (SW part), E. Washington (SE part) and North St. (NE part) contain 6 rm. singles, avg. age 10-15 yrs., price bracket $3500-7000. Franklin St. is the elite section -- large old homes and lots; avg. age 50 yrs., price bracket $5000-9000, a few as high as $12,000. The area's only local source of employment is a paper mill employing approx. 180 persons. The Cleveland industrial area is 18 miles distant; transportation on 2 hr. basis via Greyhound bus. Area's school facilities consist of one grade and one high school; one new grade school ($10,000) now under construction with aid of Federal funds. Because of its age, dormancy, lack of local employment source, and poor transportation to distant industry, this stable \"farmer's market\" community is classified in fair 3rd gr.","9":{"1":"Chagrin Falls","2":"3rd","3":"C-74","4":""},"10":""}},"D16":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.6081,-1.9967],[13.6088,-2.0009],[13.6086,-2.0007],[13.6074,-2.0011],[13.6048,-2.0016],[13.6038,-2.0019],[13.603,-2.0015],[13.6023,-2.001],[13.6009,-2.0003],[13.5999,-2.0018],[13.5994,-2.002],[13.5983,-2.0025],[13.598,-2.003],[13.5975,-2.0036],[13.5965,-2.0041],[13.5957,-2.0041],[13.5947,-2.0035],[13.5943,-2.0016],[13.594,-2.0013],[13.5933,-2.0009],[13.5928,-2.0007],[13.5923,-2.0004],[13.5927,-1.9997],[13.5926,-1.9994],[13.5922,-1.9994],[13.5917,-1.9992],[13.5909,-1.9987],[13.5912,-1.9982],[13.589,-1.9988],[13.5886,-1.9976],[13.5888,-1.9974],[13.5908,-1.9971],[13.5909,-1.9967],[13.5903,-1.9942],[13.5906,-1.9941],[13.5905,-1.9936],[13.5901,-1.9929],[13.5891,-1.9921],[13.5898,-1.9913],[13.5891,-1.991],[13.5879,-1.9903],[13.5865,-1.9893],[13.585,-1.9889],[13.5845,-1.9867],[13.585,-1.9866],[13.5853,-1.9861],[13.5858,-1.9864],[13.5866,-1.987],[13.5871,-1.9864],[13.5911,-1.9888],[13.5914,-1.9886],[13.5919,-1.9879],[13.5917,-1.987],[13.5924,-1.9868],[13.5931,-1.9867],[13.5939,-1.9868],[13.5944,-1.9867],[13.5951,-1.9863],[13.5959,-1.9858],[13.5968,-1.9854],[13.5985,-1.9846],[13.5993,-1.9842],[13.5997,-1.9843],[13.6004,-1.9845],[13.6009,-1.9848],[13.6011,-1.9852],[13.6017,-1.9856],[13.602,-1.9852],[13.6027,-1.9851],[13.6029,-1.9856],[13.6035,-1.9876],[13.6039,-1.9904],[13.6043,-1.9905],[13.6049,-1.9903],[13.6055,-1.9904],[13.606,-1.9919],[13.6056,-1.9921],[13.6045,-1.9923],[13.6045,-1.993],[13.6033,-1.9933],[13.6033,-1.9938],[13.603,-1.9944],[13.6025,-1.9947],[13.6019,-1.9918],[13.6015,-1.9918],[13.5998,-1.9921],[13.5989,-1.9895],[13.5974,-1.99],[13.5967,-1.9899],[13.5961,-1.9885],[13.5955,-1.9884],[13.595,-1.9882],[13.5946,-1.988],[13.5939,-1.9883],[13.594,-1.9892],[13.5948,-1.9917],[13.5951,-1.9934],[13.5962,-1.993],[13.5971,-1.9936],[13.5977,-1.994],[13.5977,-1.9945],[13.5982,-1.9951],[13.5996,-1.9948],[13.6,-1.9954],[13.6007,-1.9962],[13.6017,-1.9962],[13.6028,-1.9961],[13.6035,-1.997],[13.6054,-1.998],[13.6064,-1.9963],[13.6081,-1.9967]]]]},"center":[41.472,-81.652],"boundingBox":[[41.463,-81.667],[41.483,-81.638]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":1.034,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/full-size/D16.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/D16/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Cleveland/1939/D16/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Cleveland/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"About 10%","c":{"2":"Czech-Polish-Slavish"},"b":"Steel workers","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"75%","2":"25%","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"n":{"5":"Up 8%"},"m":{"4":"-8%"},"l":{"2":"$10-25 per unit"},"k":{"1":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Good"},"i":{"5":"Up 7%"},"h":{"4":"-7%"},"g":{"2":"$2000-5000"},"f":{"2":"85%"},"e":{"2":"100%"},"d":{"2":"Fairly good"},"c":{"2":"40 years"},"b":{"2":"Frame"},"a":{"2":"2 family 4-5 rm suites"}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"30","a":"(See Census Tract Map)"},"5":{"1":"1","b":"40","a":"(See Census Map)"},"6":"Not available","7":{"1":"1938","2":"$30.20"},"8":"This Broadway-East 55th Section has the largest shopping center immediately southeast of the downtown area and contains the highest concentration of Bohemian population including their social centers of churches, halls, schools, and lodges.

The stability of population and gregarious instinct of the inhabitants has held the desirability of this neighborhood beyond its detrimental influences such as smoke, dirt, and soot from industry and noise of heavy traffic. Consequently rental and sales demand has always been good although these people are \"thight raders\". This area has ample transportation, school, church and social facilities. There is an evident pride of home ownership although income of owners is too small to permit regular exterior painting and other modernization. The trend of this neighborhood will remain mostly unchanged except for the gradual obsolscence of property due to age. Although owner occupancy has been shown as 85%, the thrifty habit of these people in purchasing adjacent property should qualify in the strong holding of an additional 10% by individuals (in other words, not unwilluingly hold).
