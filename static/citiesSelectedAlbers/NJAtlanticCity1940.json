This is in spite of the fact that most of the beach front and practically all of the portion of the area west of Delancey Place is zoned as \"A\" residence. In addition the lower part of the \"Newton Tract\" is restricted by deed. Since this area was the most desirable on the island prior to the development of Ventnor and Margate, it follows that there are many homes of very large size -some of comparatively substantial age- and others of thoroughly modern vintage. The combination of generally falling prices and deteriorating neighborhood gives these houses a present-day sales value of only small fractions of former cost- probably as low as 25% to 35%. Only two blocks between Atlantic Ave. and the Boardwalk are undesirable - the west side of Columbia and Bartram and Kingston Sts. These are old houses of unattractive type crowded closely together, and useful only as rooming houses (which use is prohibited by restrictions). Recent sales of these have been made as low as $2,000. The Wanamaker family formerly owned a very large mansion fronting of Ventnor Ave. and occupying the of a large city block. Failing in efforts to sell it for any reasonable consideration, the house has been demolished. While it is true -as in all sections on Absecon Island - that values tend to recede with distance from the ocean, there are perhaps none of the larger type located away from the Boardwalk than in other areas.

Sparsely settled - approx. 40% of land is improved. This is the older portion of Margate which was originally incorporated in 1885 as South Atlantic City. Although its location between the ocean and Risley's channel is attractive it has shown no signs of development in recent years, partly because of the distance from Atlantic City (as applied to daily workers) and partly because of the presence of so many houses of substantial age and compareatively poor quality (as applied to summer residents). Among its structures are a very few 2 family dwellings, but they are not numerous enough to establish any satisfactory price record.","9":{"1":"Margate City","2":"Low 3rd","3":"C-2","4":"4/1/1940"}}},"B2":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[19.3449,-2.6371],[19.3469,-2.6388],[19.3484,-2.6399],[19.3451,-2.6436],[19.3418,-2.6473],[19.3408,-2.6486],[19.3371,-2.646],[19.3341,-2.6502],[19.3354,-2.6513],[19.3341,-2.653],[19.3307,-2.6505],[19.3306,-2.6499],[19.3306,-2.6491],[19.3304,-2.6478],[19.3301,-2.647],[19.3294,-2.6463],[19.329,-2.6458],[19.3295,-2.6451],[19.3329,-2.6476],[19.3335,-2.6468],[19.3346,-2.6476],[19.3405,-2.6392],[19.3408,-2.6393],[19.3415,-2.6382],[19.3413,-2.638],[19.3427,-2.6363],[19.3434,-2.6367],[19.3439,-2.6362],[19.3449,-2.6371]]]]},"center":[39.329,-74.503],"boundingBox":[[39.323,-74.517],[39.336,-74.491]],"name":"Margate City\r\n","holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.465,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/NJ/AtlanticCity/1940/full-size/B2.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/NJ/AtlanticCity/1940/B2/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/NJ/AtlanticCity/1940/B2/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/NJ/AtlanticCity/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"A few Jewish families moving in from farther east","d":"0","c":{"2":"n/a"},"b":"White-collar, business, professional, clerical - est. income $1500-6000","a":{"3":"n/a"}},"2":{"1":"100","2":"1-family, 5-6 rooms some larger","p":{"2":"n/a"},"o":{"2":"n/a"},"n":{"5":"n/a"},"m":{"4":"n/a"},"l":{"2":"n/a"},"k":{"2":"n/a"},"j":{"2":"n/a"},"i":{"5":"n/a"},"h":{"4":"$30-100"},"g":{"2":"$30-100"},"f":{"2":"Fair up to 8,500"},"e":{"2":"$3,500-15,000"},"d":{"2":"0%"},"c":{"2":"$3,500-18,000"},"b":{"2":"95%"},"a":{"2":"12-14 years"}},"3":{"1":"40","2":"1-family, detached. $5,200-12,000","3":"Lower priced have sold well others not well"},"4":{"b":"37","a":"14 @ $8243"},"5":{"1":"7 @ $6864","b":"Ample","a":"91"},"6":"40","7":{"1":"$104.83","2":"25, $28.30"},"8":"All city facilities-restricted- fairly convienent to Atlantic City; no business except a few local shops.

The presence of a Catholic School on Texas Ave. helps to hold them in this immediate neighborhood.

Although it enjoys the lowest effective tax rate in the entire area, the city is bankrupt.","9":{"1":"Brigantine Beach","2":"Low 3rd","3":"C-9","4":"4/1/1940"}}}}},"labelPositions":[{"id":"C6","point":[-2.588871875000001,19.366840625]},{"id":"C7","point":[-2.5839867187500003,19.385288281249995]},{"id":"C8","point":[-2.5836609375000004,19.3912953125]},{"id":"B5","point":[-2.61610703125,19.36478046875]},{"id":"C4","point":[-2.608314027035489,19.362294206857122]},{"id":"A2","point":[-2.6286906250000004,19.355128125]},{"id":"D2","point":[-2.6804207031250007,19.276398828124996]},{"id":"C10","point":[-2.6674242187499995,19.28140859375]},{"id":"C3","point":[-2.6240796875,19.353760937499995]},{"id":"B4","point":[-2.622251562499999,19.360254687500003]},{"id":"C11","point":[-2.6457384765624985,19.2880884765625]},{"id":"C12","point":[-2.6084874999999985,19.294062499999995]},{"id":"C13","point":[-2.5935457031249993,19.305658984374997]},{"id":"D3","point":[-2.59509296875,19.29581796875]},{"id":"C15","point":[-2.59483203125,19.33291640625]},{"id":"C14","point":[-2.5721601562500003,19.30766171875]},{"id":"B6","point":[-2.5586664062499995,19.31537421875]},{"id":"B7","point":[-2.548808203124999,19.312087890625]},{"id":"B1","point":[-2.6649804687499983,19.32807578125]},{"id":"C1","point":[-2.659351562499999,19.329726562499996]},{"id":"C2","point":[-2.65511953125,19.332925781249997]},{"id":"B2","point":[-2.642040625,19.342321875000007]},{"id":"A1","point":[-2.6495453124999986,19.3373453125]},{"id":"B3","point":[-2.633440624999999,19.349571875]},{"id":"C5","point":[-2.600728515625,19.374198046875005]},{"id":"D1","point":[-2.5901187500000002,19.38044375]},{"id":"C9","point":[-2.548811718750001,19.40971953125]}]}
