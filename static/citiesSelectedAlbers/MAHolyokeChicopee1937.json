The least desirable of that section of Holyoke known as Highlands located at the north central part of the city, about one mile from the shopping center. As the name implies, the area is considerably higher than the downtown section, but withal squalid and unattractive. Inharmonious uses, gas stations, a lumber yard, stores and proximity to two cemeteries at the south constitute detrimental features. Schools and churches are conveniently nearby and good transportation is available by trolley and a bus line running on Dwight Street. The neighborhood is residential and commercial in character. Inhabitants are generaly of the low income group, 95% American, mill employees and clerks. Only about 2% of the land is vacant and no new construction has been reported. Single and two family homes are interspersed with small frame and brick apartment blocks in fair to good condition. Average age of dwellings is 25 years. Average values at the peak were $8,500 for singles and $10,000 for two family houses, with shrinkage to 55% and 60% respectively. No recovery is admitted by real estate authorities. Average rentals were up to $50 for singles; $40 for apartments. These are now down to $35 and $25-$28 respectively, there having been no recovery. A slight demand and rental vacancy of 5% are noted. Dwellings are 50% owner occupied. No sales demand is apparent and sales have been negligible.

Chicopee St. is being entirely resurfaced and Meadow St. is another main thoroughfare. The area is low and flat. It was completely flooded in the Spring of 1936 and in many places the water was 15 feet deep. In fact, the southern portion of the area is flooded almost every year. The inhabitants are Polish mill workers of the poorer class who do not seem to mind these periodical floods. They will return after each experience, clean up their houses and settle down for another year. Many of these people keep chickens and a pig or two which considerably reduces family expense. They seem to prefer to exist under these circumstances and to be left along in their colony than to move to higher ground at an increased cost to the family wage earners. Many of these people were formerly employed in the Dwight Mill, now closed. Dikes are in the process of construction along the river front, which may minimize the flood hazard. There are at present no sewers in the district and of course there are no building restrictions anywhere in Chicopee. Streets are muddy and unimproved and there are no sidewalks. Poorly constructed small single cottage type houses predominate and some are built for two families. Average age of structures is 25 years. Generally, the houses are in poor condition except where rehabilitated by various relief agencies after the flood. In fact, some of the houses are in a much better condition now than before the flood because of reconditioning and the necessity of washing walls, wood-work, floors and cellars after the water receded. Silt and sand deposited by the water ultimately worked as a scouring agent, leaving floors and woodwork white and smooth after scrubbing. An average value is estimated at $1,500 or 50% of the 1929 level. There is no demand and no sales. Rentals averaging $12 to $15 a month are 50% of 1929.

Only about 10% of the land is vacant although there has been no new construction within 5 years. Average age of the homes would approximate 35 years.
