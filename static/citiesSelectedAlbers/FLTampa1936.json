The section is practically 100% occupied at the present time, as it was likewise in 1925, and at the low period of 1931 and 1932 was about 70% occupied; rental prices at the low were about 30% of the 1925 peak prices, but have since recovered to about 50%. There is no surplus of housing in this Section, neither is there any residential construction, although there is a slight demand for new houses. Foreclosures were heavy in this Section.

The Section contains some the best grade Tampa citizents, principally professional workers and retired individuals. Two story stucco on masonry residences (no frame is allowed on Davis Isalnds) ranging in price from $7,000 to $10,000 predominates; 90% of these residences are 10 years old, but are in good condition, needing only minor repairs. There is no shifting of population. The principal detrimental influence, aside from the moquitoes, is the possibility of tidal waves and tropical stroms, which possibility while rather remote, nevertheless has influenced residential activity on the ilands. The principal beneficial influences are the proximity of the Section to the City of Tampa and rigorous restrictions, combined with uniform zoning requirements on the Islands. Sales prices at the low of 1932 were about 35% of the 1925 peak prices and at the present time have recovered to about 45% of the peak, while sales volume at the low in 1932 was about 5% of the 1925 peak volume, but at the present time has recovered to 15% of the peak. This Section is now nearly 100% occupied, as it was likewise at the peak in 1925, and at the low in 1931 and 1932  was about 90% occupied. Rental prices at the low were about 20% of the 1925 peak prices, but have since recovered to about 35% of the peak prices. There is no surplus of housing in this Section and there is a good demand for new housing, as evidenced by the fact that within the last 90 days 6 or 8 new homes were built in this Section for speculative purposes, and all of them have since been sold.
