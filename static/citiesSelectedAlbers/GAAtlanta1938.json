This subdivision was developed on an extensive scale prior to the depression, but has witness no new residential construction for the past 9 years. During the depression the owner of the subdivision became financilly involved and at public sale lots sold at 10 to 20% of original sales price and in many instances sold at less than cost of paving assessments against the lots. However, the $7.500 building restrictions are still in force, which has prevented the construction of cheaper type homes. While this area has witnessed drastic shrinkage of values and heavy foreclosures, it is a desirable residential area from many standpoints and it is believed that the subdivision's desirability and values will stabilize at about present levels.
