A golf and country club is located on the mountain.     What formerly was a summer resort hotel was three years ago sold to the Alexian Brotherhood, a Catholic Organization, for use somewhat as a religious retreat and sanatorium. Some residents on the mountain claim that this has had no effect on the area from the standpoint of residential desirability, but the foot remains that there has been no new building in this area during the past three years, and while there is only one vacant house (Not including about 4 which are being repaired) rentals are about 65% of what they were 3 years ago and the only sales made have been at very low prices. With its high altitude, easy accessibility to the city, good type of population and good type of construction, it is still a very desirable place to live and will continue so, but the trend towards new building has veered to Lookout Mountain.","9":{"1":"Signal Mountain, Chattanooga, Tenn.","2":"2nd","3":"B-1","4":"6-28-39"},"10":""}},"C2":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[11.9782,-8.794],[11.9802,-8.796],[11.9812,-8.7964],[11.9829,-8.7974],[11.9851,-8.798],[11.9827,-8.8002],[11.9814,-8.803],[11.982,-8.8046],[11.982,-8.8051],[11.9791,-8.8105],[11.9786,-8.8107],[11.9756,-8.8098],[11.9754,-8.8105],[11.9741,-8.813],[11.9732,-8.8133],[11.9727,-8.8127],[11.9713,-8.8107],[11.9705,-8.8082],[11.9702,-8.8068],[11.9703,-8.8052],[11.9714,-8.8039],[11.9729,-8.8023],[11.9748,-8.8001],[11.9761,-8.7984],[11.9782,-8.794]]]]},"center":[35.094,-85.31],"boundingBox":[[35.085,-85.318],[35.103,-85.299]],"name":"White Oak - Midvale","holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.673,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/full-size/C2.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/C2/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/C2/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"-"},"b":"Skilled mechanics - white collar workers","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"100","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"12","2":"$3500","3":"Readily"},"4":{"b":"Few","a":"1"},"5":{"1":"2","b":"-","a":"3"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"8","2":"17.60"},"8":"This area lies outside city limits, is a level section, about 1/4 mile wide, lying between ridges on the east and west.

Area has city water and electric lights but no gas or public sewerage.","9":{"1":"White Oak - Midvale, Chattanooga, Tenn.","2":"3rd","3":"C-2","4":"6-29-39"},"10":""}},"B2":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[11.9851,-8.798],[11.9829,-8.7974],[11.9812,-8.7964],[11.9802,-8.796],[11.9782,-8.794],[11.9789,-8.7923],[11.9798,-8.7875],[11.9804,-8.7847],[11.9816,-8.7811],[11.9823,-8.779],[11.9827,-8.7774],[11.9833,-8.7752],[11.9842,-8.77],[11.9847,-8.7681],[11.9852,-8.7664],[11.9922,-8.7667],[11.9952,-8.7672],[11.9954,-8.7679],[11.9953,-8.7685],[11.9949,-8.7697],[11.9937,-8.7733],[11.9919,-8.7813],[11.9917,-8.7822],[11.9912,-8.7831],[11.9903,-8.7841],[11.989,-8.7854],[11.9881,-8.7871],[11.9876,-8.7895],[11.9873,-8.7915],[11.9871,-8.7931],[11.9867,-8.7948],[11.9866,-8.7962],[11.9868,-8.7972],[11.9862,-8.7981],[11.9851,-8.798]]]]},"center":[35.115,-85.294],"boundingBox":[[35.098,-85.306],[35.13,-85.28]],"name":"Red Bank","holc_grade":"B","sqmi":1.383,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/full-size/B2.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/B2/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/B2/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"-"},"b":"White collar workers, minor executives, skilled mechanics.","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"80","2":"20","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"n":{"5":"0"},"m":{"4":"(+)6"},"l":{"2":"30-40"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Good"},"i":{"5":"0"},"h":{"4":"0"},"g":{"2":"4000-5000"},"f":{"2":"90%"},"e":{"2":"100%"},"d":{"2":"Good"},"c":{"2":"10 yrs."},"b":{"2":"Frame"},"a":{"2":"6-8 rm singles"}},"3":{"1":"15","2":"3500-5000","3":"Readily"},"4":{"b":"Very few","a":"2"},"5":{"1":"2","b":"-","a":"4"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"6","2":"17.60"},"8":"This area located in Red Bank, outside Chattanooga city limits.

Available building sites are about 70% improved.","9":{"1":"Missionary Ridge, Chattanooga, Tenn.","2":"2nd","3":"B-5","4":"6-28-39"},"10":""}},"B6":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[12.0485,-8.8455],[12.0497,-8.8455],[12.0511,-8.8453],[12.0515,-8.846],[12.0518,-8.8467],[12.052,-8.8478],[12.052,-8.8488],[12.0516,-8.8513],[12.0517,-8.852],[12.052,-8.8528],[12.052,-8.8536],[12.0518,-8.8543],[12.0512,-8.8547],[12.0504,-8.8551],[12.0497,-8.8555],[12.0488,-8.8567],[12.0488,-8.8571],[12.0492,-8.8576],[12.0501,-8.8579],[12.0516,-8.8582],[12.0526,-8.8586],[12.0535,-8.8594],[12.0545,-8.8604],[12.0547,-8.861],[12.0544,-8.862],[12.0542,-8.8629],[12.0542,-8.8639],[12.0573,-8.8647],[12.0555,-8.8712],[12.0535,-8.8709],[12.0515,-8.8707],[12.0496,-8.8702],[12.0476,-8.8692],[12.0463,-8.8685],[12.0452,-8.8677],[12.0441,-8.8667],[12.0437,-8.8681],[12.0435,-8.8694],[12.0428,-8.8719],[12.0395,-8.871],[12.0365,-8.8703],[12.0348,-8.87],[12.0327,-8.8696],[12.0306,-8.8692],[12.0292,-8.8688],[12.0286,-8.8689],[12.0286,-8.8686],[12.0288,-8.8682],[12.0297,-8.8656],[12.0298,-8.8649],[12.0301,-8.8638],[12.0301,-8.863],[12.0304,-8.8623],[12.0304,-8.8617],[12.0302,-8.8602],[12.0305,-8.8602],[12.0311,-8.8603],[12.0315,-8.8604],[12.0323,-8.861],[12.0326,-8.8611],[12.0328,-8.8609],[12.0328,-8.8598],[12.0323,-8.8596],[12.0311,-8.8592],[12.0302,-8.859],[12.0302,-8.859],[12.0301,-8.8584],[12.0301,-8.8584],[12.0301,-8.8584],[12.0301,-8.8566],[12.0303,-8.8556],[12.0309,-8.8546],[12.0312,-8.8535],[12.0316,-8.8526],[12.0316,-8.8526],[12.033,-8.8528],[12.034,-8.8531],[12.0343,-8.8533],[12.0335,-8.8558],[12.0366,-8.8567],[12.037,-8.8564],[12.0374,-8.8554],[12.0377,-8.8552],[12.0383,-8.8553],[12.0386,-8.8548],[12.0399,-8.8529],[12.04,-8.8523],[12.0406,-8.8511],[12.0412,-8.8496],[12.0412,-8.849],[12.0407,-8.8485],[12.0408,-8.848],[12.0413,-8.8468],[12.0415,-8.8459],[12.042,-8.8427],[12.0439,-8.8432],[12.0452,-8.844],[12.0465,-8.8448],[12.0473,-8.8454],[12.0485,-8.8455]]]]},"center":[35.026,-85.241],"boundingBox":[[35.013,-85.26],[35.044,-85.225]],"name":"Lookout Mountain","holc_grade":"B","sqmi":2.316,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/full-size/B6.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/B6/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/B6/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"-"},"b":"Business & professional men - executives - white collar workers, skilled mechanics and some wage earners.","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"60","2":"40","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"l":{"1":"40-65"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Fair"},"i":{"5":"0"},"h":{"4":"(-)8"},"g":{"2":"3000-6000"},"f":{"2":"80%"},"e":{"2":"98%"},"d":{"2":"Fair to good"},"c":{"2":"15 yrs."},"b":{"2":"Frame & brick"},"a":{"2":"5-7 rm singles"},"n":{"5":"-"},"m":{"4":"-"}},"3":{"1":"25","2":"$3500-5000","3":"Readily"},"4":{"b":"Many","a":"14"},"5":{"1":"2","b":"$50,000 and up","a":"17"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"8","2":"36.60 inside, 17.60 outside city"},"8":"This area lies east of Missionary Ridge and is reached by a tunnel through the ridge.

It is some distance from the principal business center and the approach to the center of the city is through one of the worst sections of the city.","9":{"1":"St. Elmo, Chattanooga, Tenn.","2":"3rd","3":"C-11","4":"7-5-39"},"10":""}},"C10":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[11.981,-8.8878],[11.9822,-8.8867],[11.9827,-8.8858],[11.9832,-8.8855],[11.9843,-8.8857],[11.9852,-8.8857],[11.986,-8.886],[11.9865,-8.8861],[11.986,-8.8872],[11.9859,-8.8877],[11.986,-8.8882],[11.9864,-8.8883],[11.9869,-8.8886],[11.9872,-8.8885],[11.9879,-8.8885],[11.9885,-8.8888],[11.9899,-8.8891],[11.9908,-8.8894],[11.9909,-8.8897],[11.9908,-8.8902],[11.991,-8.8905],[11.9907,-8.8915],[11.9902,-8.8933],[11.9902,-8.8935],[11.9896,-8.8958],[11.9892,-8.8967],[11.9889,-8.8973],[11.9887,-8.898],[11.9886,-8.8986],[11.9885,-8.8995],[11.9882,-8.9004],[11.9879,-8.9014],[11.9872,-8.9027],[11.9871,-8.9034],[11.9868,-8.9039],[11.9863,-8.9055],[11.986,-8.9066],[11.9857,-8.9075],[11.9857,-8.9079],[11.9854,-8.9088],[11.985,-8.9093],[11.9841,-8.9093],[11.9837,-8.9089],[11.9831,-8.9083],[11.983,-8.9077],[11.9829,-8.9069],[11.9828,-8.9061],[11.9828,-8.9053],[11.9831,-8.9045],[11.9832,-8.904],[11.9835,-8.903],[11.9839,-8.9018],[11.9841,-8.9008],[11.9842,-8.8997],[11.9841,-8.8989],[11.9837,-8.8983],[11.9831,-8.8976],[11.9823,-8.8966],[11.9817,-8.8952],[11.9818,-8.8949],[11.982,-8.8943],[11.9826,-8.8934],[11.9826,-8.8929],[11.9826,-8.8924],[11.982,-8.8921],[11.9821,-8.8913],[11.9823,-8.8909],[11.9825,-8.8899],[11.9826,-8.8891],[11.9817,-8.8887],[11.981,-8.8882],[11.981,-8.8878]]]]},"center":[35,-85.317],"boundingBox":[[34.987,-85.323],[35.011,-85.31]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.605,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/full-size/C10.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/C10/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/C10/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"-"},"b":"Factory workers - mechanics - clerks","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"100","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"Some","a":"6"},"5":{"1":"2","b":"-","a":"5"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"8","2":"36.60"},"8":"This is a level area, formerly Alton Park.

This area is on the \"inside\" and does not include the sites overlooking the brow on either side, and therefore does not have the scenic advantages of the brow sites. For this reason, home as a whole are not as expensive as those located in the brow sites and construction is not quite as substantial.     Terrain is rolling, lots are large and well wooded. Schools, churches, and stores are located in the area. Presence of small negro population is caused by the fact that they were brought to the mountain to work as domestics for the white population. There are about forty of these negro houses, mostly owned by the occupants, they range in value from $1000 to $2000 and of course, are not worthy of second grade, but these houses are somewhat scattered and there are not sufficient of them in one spot to make a separate area.","9":{"1":"Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tenn.","2":"2nd","3":"B-8","4":"6-28-39"},"10":""}},"A4":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[11.9653,-8.9084],[11.9655,-8.9101],[11.9658,-8.9115],[11.966,-8.9129],[11.966,-8.9137],[11.9658,-8.9151],[11.9654,-8.9157],[11.9642,-8.9161],[11.9627,-8.9164],[11.9593,-8.917],[11.9586,-8.9168],[11.9578,-8.9162],[11.9573,-8.9159],[11.9571,-8.9152],[11.9569,-8.9144],[11.9569,-8.9137],[11.9571,-8.9128],[11.9571,-8.9125],[11.9566,-8.9115],[11.9572,-8.9116],[11.9584,-8.9113],[11.9593,-8.9109],[11.9599,-8.9102],[11.9601,-8.9092],[11.9603,-8.908],[11.9605,-8.9072],[11.9608,-8.9063],[11.9614,-8.9048],[11.9617,-8.9041],[11.962,-8.9031],[11.9626,-8.9013],[11.9627,-8.9008],[11.9628,-8.9004],[11.963,-8.8995],[11.9633,-8.8986],[11.9634,-8.898],[11.9634,-8.8973],[11.9635,-8.8968],[11.9636,-8.8962],[11.9636,-8.896],[11.9635,-8.8957],[11.9632,-8.8956],[11.9631,-8.8953],[11.9637,-8.8951],[11.9644,-8.8951],[11.9646,-8.8955],[11.9646,-8.8968],[11.9646,-8.8972],[11.9645,-8.8978],[11.9646,-8.8987],[11.9645,-8.9006],[11.9647,-8.9014],[11.9648,-8.9029],[11.9648,-8.9052],[11.965,-8.9067],[11.965,-8.9074],[11.9653,-8.9084]],[[11.9558,-8.9097],[11.9546,-8.9103],[11.9539,-8.9104],[11.9539,-8.9097],[11.954,-8.9093],[11.9538,-8.9085],[11.9536,-8.9065],[11.9538,-8.9058],[11.954,-8.9044],[11.9542,-8.9034],[11.9547,-8.9024],[11.9548,-8.9018],[11.9548,-8.9007],[11.9555,-8.9002],[11.9561,-8.8993],[11.9572,-8.898],[11.9588,-8.8965],[11.9591,-8.8959],[11.9595,-8.8955],[11.9601,-8.8936],[11.9606,-8.8927],[11.9608,-8.8921],[11.9615,-8.891],[11.962,-8.8901],[11.9626,-8.8904],[11.9631,-8.8921],[11.9634,-8.8935],[11.9627,-8.894],[11.9625,-8.8947],[11.9619,-8.8949],[11.9613,-8.8953],[11.9607,-8.8958],[11.9605,-8.8962],[11.9599,-8.8971],[11.9593,-8.8979],[11.9591,-8.8986],[11.9587,-8.8996],[11.9584,-8.9006],[11.9579,-8.9018],[11.9574,-8.903],[11.9573,-8.9042],[11.9568,-8.9053],[11.9555,-8.9065],[11.9552,-8.9072],[11.9553,-8.9077],[11.9554,-8.9083],[11.9556,-8.9091],[11.9558,-8.9097]]]]},"center":[34.994,-85.349],"boundingBox":[[34.984,-85.358],[35.01,-85.342]],"name":"Lookout Mountain","holc_grade":"A","sqmi":0.686,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/full-size/A4.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/A4/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/TN/Chattanooga/1939/A4/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/TN/Chattanooga/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"-"},"b":"Business & professional men - executives - capitalists.","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"70","2":"30","p":{"2":"-"},"j":{"2":"Good for cheaper only"},"i":{"5":"0"},"h":{"4":"0"},"g":{"2":"7500-35,000"},"f":{"2":"100%"},"e":{"2":"100%"},"d":{"2":"Good"},"c":{"2":"12 yrs."},"b":{"2":"Frame - brick - stone"},"a":{"2":"6-10 rm singles"},"o":{"2":"-"},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":"None"},"k":{"2":"Firm"}},"3":{"1":"12","2":"$6500-10,000","3":"Built by lot owners"},"4":{"b":"0","a":"0"},"5":{"1":"2","b":"-","a":"1"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"8","2":"32.60"},"8":"This area is located on Lookout Mountain and includes both East Brow and West Brow, which overlook the country for miles around, and on which many beautiful and costly homes have been built.
