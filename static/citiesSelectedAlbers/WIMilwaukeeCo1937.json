That portion south of Lisbon is the oldest part of the area. It is now a wage earners' area with the advantages of being close in. It has a number of small industrial plants also 5 business streets. That portion north of North Avenue is slightly better than south of North Avenue, being not as old. The section west of 20th Street is better than that east of 20th. A good fourth grade area.","6":{"1":"MILWAUKEE, WIS.","2":"D","3":"6"}}},"C8":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[8.7833,-1.2633],[8.7834,-1.2636],[8.7836,-1.2644],[8.7837,-1.2653],[8.7839,-1.2667],[8.7841,-1.2682],[8.7843,-1.2696],[8.7845,-1.2713],[8.7848,-1.273],[8.785,-1.2747],[8.7852,-1.276],[8.7853,-1.277],[8.7854,-1.2778],[8.785,-1.2779],[8.7845,-1.278],[8.7847,-1.2792],[8.7848,-1.2798],[8.7848,-1.2805],[8.785,-1.2817],[8.7852,-1.283],[8.7854,-1.284],[8.7855,-1.285],[8.7853,-1.2852],[8.7841,-1.2853],[8.7828,-1.2855],[8.7817,-1.2857],[8.7815,-1.2856],[8.7811,-1.2856],[8.7809,-1.2841],[8.7807,-1.2823],[8.7804,-1.2804],[8.7802,-1.2786],[8.7792,-1.2787],[8.7767,-1.2791],[8.7719,-1.2797],[8.7688,-1.2802],[8.766,-1.2806],[8.7624,-1.2812],[8.7602,-1.2814],[8.7584,-1.2817],[8.7569,-1.2819],[8.7567,-1.2809],[8.7566,-1.2801],[8.7564,-1.28],[8.7549,-1.2801],[8.7545,-1.2802],[8.7544,-1.2799],[8.7542,-1.2785],[8.7541,-1.2785],[8.7533,-1.2785],[8.7533,-1.2779],[8.7521,-1.2781],[8.752,-1.2777],[8.7519,-1.2772],[8.7518,-1.2767],[8.7518,-1.2763],[8.7517,-1.2759],[8.7516,-1.2755],[8.7516,-1.2751],[8.7515,-1.2746],[8.7514,-1.2742],[8.7513,-1.274],[8.7512,-1.2735],[8.7512,-1.2735],[8.7512,-1.2731],[8.751,-1.2725],[8.7509,-1.2722],[8.7509,-1.2717],[8.7508,-1.2714],[8.7505,-1.2713],[8.7508,-1.2711],[8.7519,-1.271],[8.752,-1.2708],[8.7518,-1.2694],[8.7517,-1.2689],[8.7527,-1.2688],[8.7538,-1.2686],[8.7548,-1.2684],[8.7546,-1.2675],[8.7546,-1.267],[8.7549,-1.2669],[8.7552,-1.2669],[8.7555,-1.2669],[8.7559,-1.2668],[8.7564,-1.2667],[8.7568,-1.2667],[8.7573,-1.2666],[8.7579,-1.2665],[8.7582,-1.2665],[8.7586,-1.2664],[8.7588,-1.2664],[8.7591,-1.2664],[8.7595,-1.2663],[8.7599,-1.2663],[8.7603,-1.2662],[8.7607,-1.2662],[8.7613,-1.2661],[8.7618,-1.2661],[8.7624,-1.266],[8.7629,-1.2659],[8.7632,-1.2659],[8.7635,-1.2659],[8.7637,-1.2658],[8.764,-1.2658],[8.7643,-1.2658],[8.7646,-1.2657],[8.765,-1.2657],[8.7653,-1.2656],[8.7655,-1.2656],[8.7658,-1.2656],[8.7661,-1.2655],[8.7664,-1.2655],[8.7666,-1.2655],[8.767,-1.2654],[8.7675,-1.2653],[8.7679,-1.2653],[8.7683,-1.2652],[8.7685,-1.2652],[8.7687,-1.2652],[8.7691,-1.2651],[8.7694,-1.2651],[8.7697,-1.2651],[8.7701,-1.265],[8.7705,-1.265],[8.7707,-1.2649],[8.7711,-1.2649],[8.7715,-1.2648],[8.7718,-1.2648],[8.7721,-1.2648],[8.7723,-1.2647],[8.7726,-1.2647],[8.7731,-1.2646],[8.7733,-1.2646],[8.7736,-1.2646],[8.774,-1.2645],[8.7744,-1.2645],[8.7749,-1.2644],[8.7752,-1.2644],[8.7755,-1.2643],[8.7758,-1.2643],[8.7761,-1.2643],[8.7765,-1.2642],[8.7768,-1.2641],[8.7772,-1.2641],[8.7776,-1.264],[8.7779,-1.264],[8.7782,-1.264],[8.7786,-1.2639],[8.7789,-1.2639],[8.7793,-1.2638],[8.7797,-1.2638],[8.78,-1.2637],[8.7804,-1.2637],[8.7809,-1.2636],[8.7812,-1.2636],[8.7815,-1.2635],[8.7819,-1.2635],[8.7823,-1.2634],[8.7825,-1.2634],[8.7828,-1.2634],[8.783,-1.2633],[8.7833,-1.2633]],[[8.7622,-1.2667],[8.7629,-1.2724],[8.7632,-1.2727],[8.7636,-1.273],[8.7642,-1.2735],[8.7649,-1.2741],[8.7653,-1.2745],[8.7672,-1.2742],[8.7668,-1.2732],[8.7666,-1.2727],[8.7665,-1.2723],[8.7663,-1.2718],[8.766,-1.271],[8.7657,-1.2705],[8.7656,-1.2702],[8.7654,-1.2696],[8.7652,-1.2692],[8.7649,-1.2687],[8.7644,-1.268],[8.7639,-1.2671],[8.7635,-1.2665],[8.7622,-1.2667]]]]},"center":[43.074,-87.928],"boundingBox":[[43.06,-87.954],[43.083,-87.907]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":2.32,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/WI/Milwaukee/1937/full-size/C8.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/WI/Milwaukee/1937/C8/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/WI/Milwaukee/1937/C8/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/WI/Milwaukee/1937/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Static - down","d":"98","c":"None outstanding.
