However, low percent of land improvements and many favorable factors indicate future prospects of better development. Large contiguous tracts of undeveloped land that can be purchased at acreage prices would seem to offer opportunity for speculation and/or resubdividing. That part of this area lying west of Edwards Avenue was seriously handicapped at the time it was subdivided and placed on the market some twelve years ago. The promoters offered a bonus of $50 worth of lumber with each lot, for the purpose of building temporary shelter. In many cases, the resulting shacks have been added to and improved until now there are many very small, poorly designed dwellings, showing little evidence of pride of ownership. Marketability is limited, values are problematical and the majority of residents have little financial responsibility. The area has been further handicapped by the installation of costly street improvements in 1930, which resulted in heavy property assessments and the subsequent loss of many lots and homes. These street improvements resulted in a scandal, involving several city officials. The bonds which were issued in payment, were sold for as little as twenty cents on the dollar and land values sank to the vanishing point. During the depression there were many foreclosures in this area and a large percentage of vacant houses. Recovery has been slow in a large part of the district. The city owns a reservoir site west of Tiller Avenue and south of Mountain Boulevard. The section east of this reservoir is sparsely settled and gives promise of developing into a higher grade area.","15":{"1":"Walter N. Gabriel; City of Okaland, Building Inspector; Ralph E.

It is still too sparsely settled to predict a definite trend. The area was first put on as a subdivision in 1927 and many building and loan associations placed construction loans here. A number of these loans were foreclosed during the depression period and in consequence, there was an extraordinary drop in values. Some of the more pretentious homes, selling for as little as one-third of their original cost. For these reasons, recovery of values have been slow and halting(?) in comparison with some of the older areas. There is a new highway under construction through the area at the present time and since January 1, 1937, there has been a renewed sales activity here. David D. Bohanon, a speculative builder, has purchased a large number of lots in this area and recently started a program of construction, which comtemplates the building of between three hundred and four hundred, five and six-room houses, the sale price of which will be about $4.50 per square foot, plus the price of the lot, which will average in the neighborhood of $1,000. The architecture and type of homes which already have been completed is such that if, so and when, the program is finished, it is possible that that particular portion of the area should be raised as an \"A\" Green grade. It is understood that this building activity will be largely financed with F.H.A. funds.","15":{"1":"Walter N. Gabriel, City of Oakland Building Inspector's Office; Ralph E.
