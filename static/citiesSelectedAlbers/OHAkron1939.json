This is the cheapest residential neighborhood in Barberton. Income of occupants is very low and unstable. Inadequate facilities for sewage disposal. No utilities in area except water and electricity. Public school between Bell and Van Buren Streets. Unemployment and relief rolls are very heavy; about 20% of streets are paved. This area is rapidly declining and property, if acquired, should be sold for any reasonable offer.","9":{"1":"Akron, Ohio Barberton","2":"D","3":"12","4":"Fed '39"}}},"B16":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.7346,-2.4199],[13.7355,-2.4239],[13.7309,-2.4249],[13.7303,-2.4229],[13.7311,-2.4226],[13.7308,-2.4205],[13.7328,-2.42],[13.7331,-2.4213],[13.7336,-2.4212],[13.7334,-2.4198],[13.7345,-2.4195],[13.7346,-2.4199]]]]},"center":[41.026,-81.597],"boundingBox":[[41.024,-81.601],[41.028,-81.594]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.089,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Akron/1939/full-size/B16.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Akron/1939/B16/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Akron/1939/B16/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Akron/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"","d":"0","c":{"2":""},"b":"Business men and store keepers","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"90","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"1, 3-31-39"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"3, 3-31-39"},"6":"Available up to 60% of appraisal","7":{"1":"8","2":"22.4"},"8":"The characteristics of this section are as follows: platted - 1910; built up 80%; streets paved; transportation - good; school facilities – good; terrain – fairly level.

Vehicular traffic is heavy on Hawkins Avenue. The more expensive homes are located on Seudder and Auton Avenues. Progress in this area will be slow for a few years until proper drainage has occurred. However, due to general excellence of surrounding areas this neighborhood will retain its present level and possibly improve.

The highly restricted improvements are located north of Dolin Avenue. Homes gradually lower in prices from Stadelman Avenue to the south. The area is built up 65 per cent and convenient to stores, schools, and churches. Eight new homes were constructed last year.

Originally developed in 1920 as an ultra-exclusive district, separate from Akron, this area was named the Village of Fairlawn. However, the severity of the 1930 decline in home construction in this rapidly developed area, due to its very exclusiveness and unwarranted size, caused the promoters to petition for annexation. This was approved by the City of Akron in 1932. The main part, containing the most beautiful and expensive homes ( a few cost as high at $70,000) lies south of the Akron-Medina Road on an artistically landscaped, heavily wooded plateau. (Since plateau rises approximately 100 feet above the A.C. Y. railroad at south end, there is little if any influence by this usual detriment.) The lots average 70 foot frontage and are traversed by excellent winding streets (70% in area paved). The area is now built up 35% -- formerly, the minimum improvement restriction was $15,000 but now has been reduced to $12,500. Six homes from $14,000 up were built in area last year. Due to the city's weak financial condition, installation of utilities has been slow and has delayed development of area. However, all utilities now have been installed except gas and electricity in 50% of area (mostly undeveloped).

Later development and installation of utilities brought the building of better type homes. The subject area surrounds the short business district of Kenmore which lies on Kenmore Boulevard between 11th and 18th streets. The average lot frontage is 40 feet; built up 50%; transportation fair to limited; schools, churches and stores convenient only to southern and eastern parts of area. The best homes and most desirable section of the area lie in that part east of 13th Street between Indian Trail and Montana – Viewland Avenues. This section, situation on a plateau and known as Overlook Allotment, was platted into a first-class residential district of 50-foot front lots – is now 75% built up and will improve. However, general outlook for balance of area if only fair and little hope exists for improvement of central western part due to cheapness of homes and low locality.","9":{"1":"Formerly Kenmore, Akron, Ohio","2":"B","3":"11","4":"Feb '39"}}},"C19":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[13.7551,-2.3803],[13.7524,-2.3873],[13.75,-2.3924],[13.7506,-2.3954],[13.7511,-2.3954],[13.7523,-2.402],[13.7515,-2.4026],[13.7512,-2.4034],[13.7512,-2.4041],[13.751,-2.4049],[13.7502,-2.4054],[13.7459,-2.4087],[13.7451,-2.4088],[13.746,-2.4053],[13.7452,-2.4054],[13.7438,-2.4059],[13.7424,-2.4061],[13.7413,-2.4063],[13.7405,-2.4068],[13.7357,-2.4075],[13.7353,-2.4057],[13.7446,-2.4038],[13.745,-2.4034],[13.745,-2.4027],[13.7448,-2.4019],[13.7438,-2.3997],[13.7426,-2.3936],[13.7454,-2.3932],[13.7449,-2.3926],[13.7447,-2.3914],[13.7446,-2.3901],[13.7443,-2.3887],[13.7432,-2.3866],[13.7417,-2.3852],[13.7417,-2.3845],[13.7425,-2.3836],[13.7426,-2.3823],[13.7423,-2.3811],[13.7444,-2.3797],[13.7461,-2.3788],[13.7478,-2.3815],[13.75,-2.3815],[13.7551,-2.3803]]]]},"center":[41.051,-81.57],"boundingBox":[[41.036,-81.589],[41.065,-81.556]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":1.108,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Akron/1939/full-size/C19.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Akron/1939/C19/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Akron/1939/C19/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Akron/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"","d":"0","c":{"2":"Mixed"},"b":"Laborers - factory workers","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"65","2":"35","p":{"2":"Static"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"n":{"5":"-9"},"m":{"4":"19"},"h":{"2":"17"},"g":{"2":"2000-4200"},"f":{"2":"65%"},"e":{"2":"65%"},"d":{"2":"Fair"},"c":{"2":"15 yrs."},"b":{"2":"Frame"},"a":{"2":"2 story single family 6 rooms"},"l":{"2":"15-32"},"k":{"2":"Static"},"j":{"2":"Slow"},"i":{"5":"-8"}},"3":{"1":"20","2":"$2250","3":"Slow"},"4":{"b":"","a":"8, 3-31-39"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"4, 3-31-39"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"8","2":"28.90"},"8":"This is one of the newer districts developed about 1920.

One of the city’s Metropolitan Parks abuts this area’s northeast boundary. Due to the surrounding influences of slightly cheaper homes and the lessening desirability of the entire east side of city in the eyes of high type occupants, this area has reached its peak, but will remain more desirable than the surrounding “Blue” territory, since only age will affect its superiority.
