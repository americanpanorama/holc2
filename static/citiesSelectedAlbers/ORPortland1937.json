This subdivision was first placed upon the market some fourteen years ago, but the greater part of the residences have been constructed within the past five years, with the heighth of activity occurring in 1937. The promotion was well handled and the residences which have been constructed are of a type which would justify a 1st grade designation, however public improvements have not kept pace with private construction and a lack of particular appeal in location, which is not in line of the city’s growth, make it inadvisable at this time to accord better than a high blue grade. There are but few, if any, HOLC loans in the area.","6":{"1":"Maywood Park","2":"B+","3":"25"}}},"B18":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-15.5628,2.7595],[-15.5649,2.7532],[-15.5638,2.7529],[-15.5642,2.7516],[-15.5607,2.7506],[-15.5611,2.7494],[-15.555,2.7477],[-15.5558,2.7448],[-15.5583,2.7442],[-15.5597,2.7442],[-15.5604,2.7447],[-15.5607,2.7451],[-15.5614,2.7452],[-15.5623,2.7455],[-15.5617,2.7462],[-15.5625,2.7464],[-15.5632,2.747],[-15.5644,2.7474],[-15.5645,2.7484],[-15.5641,2.7502],[-15.5672,2.7513],[-15.5663,2.7541],[-15.5663,2.7559],[-15.5676,2.7563],[-15.5666,2.7595],[-15.57,2.7606],[-15.5699,2.7609],[-15.5692,2.7633],[-15.5659,2.7623],[-15.5662,2.7612],[-15.5646,2.7607],[-15.5647,2.7601],[-15.5628,2.7595]]]]},"center":[45.548,-122.618],"boundingBox":[[45.541,-122.631],[45.557,-122.605]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.369,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OR/Portland/1937/full-size/B18.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OR/Portland/1937/B18/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OR/Portland/1937/B18/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OR/Portland/1937/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Upward","d":"85","c":"Northern portion somewhat remote from trading center.","b":"Convenience to schools, churches, bus transportation and shopping centers.

Council Crest Park, which was developed by the Street Railway Company as an amusement park, has now been taken over by the city and will be improved as a recreational area, which it is believed will be beneficial to this area. With very few exceptions maintenance indicates a high degree of pride of ownership, owing to the sluggishness and mixed character of development the area is assigned a low green grade. HOLC loans in area approximate 7 for an aggregate of $28,000.","6":{"1":"Council Crest","2":"A-","3":"11"}}},"A10":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-15.631,2.7322],[-15.6311,2.732],[-15.6304,2.7323],[-15.6299,2.7323],[-15.6296,2.7321],[-15.6255,2.7291],[-15.6262,2.728],[-15.6265,2.7276],[-15.6269,2.7273],[-15.6275,2.7271],[-15.628,2.7271],[-15.6288,2.7274],[-15.6292,2.7279],[-15.6296,2.7279],[-15.6296,2.7277],[-15.6295,2.7273],[-15.6287,2.7261],[-15.629,2.7256],[-15.6294,2.7256],[-15.6297,2.7258],[-15.6298,2.7265],[-15.6299,2.7273],[-15.6301,2.7275],[-15.6304,2.7276],[-15.6305,2.7273],[-15.6305,2.7267],[-15.6309,2.7265],[-15.6311,2.7254],[-15.632,2.7243],[-15.6331,2.7239],[-15.634,2.7239],[-15.6341,2.7241],[-15.6337,2.725],[-15.6333,2.7252],[-15.6335,2.7255],[-15.6339,2.7253],[-15.6348,2.725],[-15.6358,2.7247],[-15.6361,2.7244],[-15.6369,2.7247],[-15.6375,2.7249],[-15.6379,2.7248],[-15.6387,2.7257],[-15.6388,2.7261],[-15.6387,2.7265],[-15.6389,2.7273],[-15.6386,2.7276],[-15.6377,2.7276],[-15.6373,2.7278],[-15.6367,2.7276],[-15.6364,2.7275],[-15.6362,2.727],[-15.635,2.7275],[-15.6334,2.7283],[-15.6331,2.7286],[-15.6332,2.7288],[-15.6349,2.7294],[-15.6352,2.7295],[-15.6353,2.7305],[-15.6353,2.7309],[-15.635,2.7315],[-15.6341,2.7319],[-15.6338,2.7317],[-15.6336,2.7311],[-15.6333,2.7311],[-15.6334,2.7316],[-15.6329,2.732],[-15.6324,2.7322],[-15.632,2.7327],[-15.6315,2.7329],[-15.6312,2.7327],[-15.631,2.7322]]]]},"center":[45.506,-122.704],"boundingBox":[[45.501,-122.713],[45.51,-122.695]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"A","sqmi":0.281,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OR/Portland/1937/full-size/A10.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OR/Portland/1937/A10/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OR/Portland/1937/A10/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OR/Portland/1937/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Upward","d":"70","c":"Characterized by steep grades which make automobile travel hazardous in the rare periods of low temperature.
