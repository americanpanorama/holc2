comprised of small cottages and shacks ranging in price from $300 – 1800. A small number of occupants have home-made hot beds and greenhouses and derive their livelihood from this source. Soil consists of rich muck suitable for gardening. No paved streets. No utilities except electricity. Considerable distance to school’ one mile to bus line on Copley. Akron Belt Line and Copley swamp ditch traverses through area. Four negro families on Columbus Avenue; fertility of soil and cheapness of lot prices (lots at $50 – 75) is main attraction to purchasers with meager earning power.

The cheapest homes in this area are located in the extreme northeast corner north of Bath-Stow Road. Trend is static to slightly upward.

Originally developed in 1920 as an ultra-exclusive district, separate from Akron, this area was named the Village of Fairlawn. However, the severity of the 1930 decline in home construction in this rapidly developed area, due to its very exclusiveness and unwarranted size, caused the promoters to petition for annexation. This was approved by the City of Akron in 1932. The main part, containing the most beautiful and expensive homes ( a few cost as high at $70,000) lies south of the Akron-Medina Road on an artistically landscaped, heavily wooded plateau. (Since plateau rises approximately 100 feet above the A.C. Y. railroad at south end, there is little if any influence by this usual detriment.) The lots average 70 foot frontage and are traversed by excellent winding streets (70% in area paved). The area is now built up 35% -- formerly, the minimum improvement restriction was $15,000 but now has been reduced to $12,500. Six homes from $14,000 up were built in area last year. Due to the city's weak financial condition, installation of utilities has been slow and has delayed development of area. However, all utilities now have been installed except gas and electricity in 50% of area (mostly undeveloped). Schools, churches, and stores are convenient; transportation is only fair, but not important to this type of resident.

The subject area surrounds the short business district of Kenmore which lies on Kenmore Boulevard between 11th and 18th streets. The average lot frontage is 40 feet; built up 50%; transportation fair to limited; schools, churches and stores convenient only to southern and eastern parts of area. The best homes and most desirable section of the area lie in that part east of 13th Street between Indian Trail and Montana – Viewland Avenues. This section, situation on a plateau and known as Overlook Allotment, was platted into a first-class residential district of 50-foot front lots – is now 75% built up and will improve. However, general outlook for balance of area if only fair and little hope exists for improvement of central western part due to cheapness of homes and low locality.","9":{"1":"Formerly Kenmore, Akron, Ohio","2":"B","3":"11","4":"Feb '39"}}},"C19":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-81.5562,41.0619],[-81.5617,41.0558],[-81.5663,41.0513],[-81.5663,41.0482],[-81.5657,41.0482],[-81.566,41.0414],[-81.5673,41.0411],[-81.5679,41.0404],[-81.568,41.0396],[-81.5685,41.039],[-81.5697,41.0387],[-81.5762,41.0364],[-81.5774,41.0365],[-81.5751,41.0397],[-81.5762,41.0397],[-81.5783,41.0395],[-81.5801,41.0397],[-81.5816,41.0398],[-81.5827,41.0395],[-81.5892,41.0398],[-81.5892,41.0417],[-81.5766,41.0415],[-81.5759,41.0417],[-81.5758,41.0424],[-81.5757,41.0433],[-81.5764,41.0456],[-81.5763,41.0518],[-81.5724,41.0516],[-81.5729,41.0523],[-81.5729,41.0535],[-81.5726,41.0548],[-81.5726,41.0561],[-81.5734,41.0584],[-81.575,41.0602],[-81.5748,41.0608],[-81.5736,41.0616],[-81.573,41.0628],[-81.573,41.064],[-81.5699,41.0649],[-81.5675,41.0654],[-81.566,41.0624],[-81.5632,41.0619],[-81.5562,41.0619]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.045972265625,-81.571018359375],"center":[41.051,-81.57],"boundingBox":[[41.036,-81.589],[41.065,-81.556]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":1.108,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Akron/1939/full-size/C19.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Akron/1939/C19/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Akron/1939/C19/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/OH/Akron/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"","d":"0","c":{"2":"Mixed"},"b":"Laborers - factory workers","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"65","2":"35","p":{"2":"Static"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"n":{"5":"-9"},"m":{"4":"19"},"l":{"2":"15-32"},"k":{"2":"Static"},"j":{"2":"Slow"},"i":{"5":"-8"},"h":{"4":"16"},"g":{"2":"2000-4200"},"f":{"2":"65%"},"e":{"2":"65%"},"d":{"2":"Fair"},"c":{"2":"15 yrs."},"b":{"2":"Frame"},"a":{"2":"2 story single family 6 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"20","2":"$2250","3":"Slow"},"4":{"b":"","a":"8, 3-31-39"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"4, 3-31-39"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"8","2":"28.90"},"8":"This is one of the newer districts developed about 1920.
