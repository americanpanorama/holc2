Approximately 10% of improvements are of the mansion type occupying from one to five acres and costing in some cases up to $1,000,000. A typical structures of this kind is the 30 to 40 room residence of Phil Wrigley, which occupies the whole block on the west side of Orange Grove Ave. between Arbor and Lockhaven Streets. Many nationally known captains of fiancé and industry maintain homes in this area. During the past several years new arterial shave been constructed which greatly accelerate auto travel to Los Angeles. This has attracted Los Angeles business and professional men to this area and many new 6 to 8 room homes have been constructed. The new improvements have been largely built along Bradford and Bellefontaine Sts.

These prices seem out of proportion compared with lot values in other parts of the city. While this area has many of the qualifications of a first grade area and the district will undoubtedly retain its desirability as a single-family residential section for a great many years to come, the average age of improvements and the large number which are “for sale” precludes assignment of better than a “high blue” grade.","9":{"1":"Orange Grove Av.

It was quite popular and was developing rapidly until drilling for oil commenced just east of this area. This stopped activity and caused a slump in values. It is said that very recently the well “came in dry”. If further drilling is abandoned it will favorable affect the district. Construction is of high standard quality and maintenance is of good character. Population is homogeneous, and architectural designs are harmonious. Pending definite determination of oil well development the area is accorded a provisional “medial blue” grade with indications that this grade may be increased with future favorable development.","9":{"1":"Hyde Park","2":"2nd","3":"B-116","4":"5-4-39"},"10":""}},"C7":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-118.3975,34.1504],[-118.3965,34.1504],[-118.3954,34.1496],[-118.3921,34.1495],[-118.3919,34.1468],[-118.3929,34.1442],[-118.3956,34.145],[-118.3964,34.1468],[-118.3974,34.1468],[-118.3975,34.1504]]]]},"labelCoords":[34.14717499999999,-118.394175],"center":[34.147,-118.395],"boundingBox":[[34.144,-118.397],[34.15,-118.392]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.096,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/C7.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/C7/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/C7/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None apparent","d":"0","c":{"2":"None subversive"},"b":"Business and professional men, retired people, white collar workers, artisans and city employees.

This area was subdivided about 15 years ago. Early development was not rapid and many of the improvements that period were of questionable construction. During the past five years activity has steadily increased and currently it is a “hot spot”. In the older parts area presents a somewhat heterogeneous appearance owing to diversity of age and types. New construction, however, has minimized this defect and in newer portions improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are harmonious and of much better quality. While there are a number of multi-family structures they are of the smaller types and are confined to definite sections. This is a medium income area of moderately priced homes. Lot values range from $20 to $25 per front foot and these comparatively low prices have attracted a number of speculative builders.

Probably 150 of these 5 and 6 room dwellings have been constructed since 1936 and have greatly improved the aspect of the whole area. It is difficult to predict the future trend of this area, but it is felt that a provisional grade of “medial yellow” is warranted.","9":{"1":"N.W.

There has recently been quite an influx of new population due to expansion and increased oil well activity, and this has caused an active demand for housing which has been partially supplied by new dwellings financed under FHA TItle I. The area is entirely blighted and is therefore accorded a \"low red\" grade.","9":{"1":"Leminta (in L.A. County) Harbor City (L.A.

Construction during period was generally of substandard quality and much of it was of the “Jerry built” variety. As a result of this the area presents a heterogeneous aspect. This is particularly true of that part west of Redondo Ave. The eastern part is newer and somewhat better grade. However, the whole area is spotted and is slowly trending to income properties. Lot values range from $20 to $100 per front foot, prices depreciating noticeably going north. New construction is of standard quality and maintenance in general is of fair character. Population, while not homogeneous, is generally stable. There are many multiple family structures in the area, mostly of medium quality, which cater to the tourist trade. While this area is declining, it will be many years before it becomes generally blighted. It is therefore thought entitled to a “medial yellow” grade.","9":{"1":"Long Beach","2":"3rd","3":"C-156","4":"5-4-39"},"10":""}},"D63":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-118.19,33.7934],[-118.19,33.7907],[-118.1926,33.7908],[-118.1926,33.7889],[-118.1901,33.7889],[-118.1901,33.7839],[-118.1926,33.7839],[-118.1926,33.7934],[-118.1902,33.7935],[-118.1901,33.8043],[-118.1904,33.8045],[-118.1903,33.8183],[-118.1786,33.8184],[-118.1785,33.8153],[-118.1762,33.8153],[-118.1762,33.817],[-118.172,33.8172],[-118.1719,33.8188],[-118.1676,33.8188],[-118.1678,33.8116],[-118.1593,33.8116],[-118.1579,33.8111],[-118.1556,33.8104],[-118.1514,33.8105],[-118.1512,33.8065],[-118.1514,33.7973],[-118.1485,33.7953],[-118.1426,33.7902],[-118.1456,33.79],[-118.1457,33.7877],[-118.1459,33.7834],[-118.1486,33.7834],[-118.1486,33.7824],[-118.1501,33.7826],[-118.1585,33.7824],[-118.1619,33.7825],[-118.1678,33.7825],[-118.1691,33.7825],[-118.1728,33.7826],[-118.1778,33.7827],[-118.1778,33.7827],[-118.1778,33.7827],[-118.1773,33.7841],[-118.1883,33.7839],[-118.1885,33.7889],[-118.1851,33.789],[-118.1851,33.7907],[-118.1885,33.7908],[-118.1885,33.7934],[-118.19,33.7934]],[[-118.1806,33.8061],[-118.1805,33.8046],[-118.1765,33.8047],[-118.1765,33.8062],[-118.1789,33.8062],[-118.1806,33.8061]],[[-118.185,33.7858],[-118.1807,33.7858],[-118.1808,33.7879],[-118.185,33.788],[-118.185,33.7858]]]]},"labelCoords":[33.799,-118.17],"center":[33.799,-118.17],"boundingBox":[[33.782,-118.193],[33.819,-118.143]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":5.159,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/D63.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/D63/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/D63/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Slow increases of subversive racial elements.","d":"5","c":{"2":"Mexicans, Japanese & Italians"},"b":"Artisans, oil well, service & white collar workers, Petty Naval officers, etc. Income $1200-2500","a":{"3":"-"}},"2":{"1":"80","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"h":{"1":"2000-2750"},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":"Apts. & Multi-family 10%"},"a":{"2":"Large old dwellings 10%"},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""}},"3":{"1":"50","2":"5 rooms $3500-$3750","3":"Moderately"},"4":{"b":"Few","a":"3"},"5":{"1":"3","b":"Few","a":"38"},"6":"Limited and Selective","7":{"1":"7-38","2":"53.40 County $37.80 - City $15.60"},"8":"Terrain: Level to rolling with noticeable slope from north to south.

Conveniences are not readily available. This exclusive and sequestered district was subdivided in 1925 and has been slowly developed since that time. A re-subdivision of some of the large acreage plots was recently made with the mutual consent of all property owners of the area. This will undoubtedly stimulate further development as the district is very highly regarded. Construction, architectural designs and maintenance are of the very highest character. It is not practical to designate a predominating type and size or to give price brackets as extent of home sites largely govern prices. In a general way it might be states that estates have cost owners from $25000 to $1000000. The area has been very carefully developed and population is homogeneous, and has a high community pride.

No construction hazards. The Eaton Wash runs through area just west of Sierra Madre Ave. This Wash has never been considered a flood menace and now has been included in County flood control program. Deed restrictions are said to be ample and enforced. Schools are readily available and of excellent quality. Churches are nearby. Trading centers are distant and shopping is done by telephone. Transportation is inadequate and largely dependent upon private conveyance, which, in district of this character, is not a great handicap. This section has been largely developed within the past 5 years and while still sparsely built up in parts has made great headway as a whole. Both Huntington Dr. and Mission Blvd. are arteries to Los Angeles, where many residents are in business. Construction, maintenance and architectural designs are of high character.

The area has many of the qualifications of a first grade area, but this slight tendency toward multi-family development loads to the belief that a “high blue” grade is more in keeping with the future trend.","9":{"1":"Laughlin Park","2":"2nd +","3":"B-73","4":"2-28-39"},"10":""}},"D44":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-118.3612,33.9165],[-118.36,33.9165],[-118.36,33.9118],[-118.3438,33.9117],[-118.3438,33.9163],[-118.3438,33.9183],[-118.3352,33.9183],[-118.3353,33.9165],[-118.3352,33.9091],[-118.3267,33.9091],[-118.3267,33.8949],[-118.3329,33.8948],[-118.333,33.9018],[-118.3442,33.9019],[-118.3439,33.891],[-118.3438,33.8774],[-118.3526,33.8745],[-118.3548,33.8728],[-118.3612,33.8727],[-118.3613,33.8803],[-118.3613,33.8934],[-118.3614,33.9019],[-118.3701,33.9017],[-118.3698,33.9164],[-118.3612,33.9165]],[[-118.3466,33.9018],[-118.3504,33.9018],[-118.3503,33.9002],[-118.3464,33.9002],[-118.3466,33.9018]]]]},"labelCoords":[33.898,-118.35],"center":[33.898,-118.35],"boundingBox":[[33.873,-118.37],[33.918,-118.327]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":4.051,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/D44.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/D44/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/D44/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None apparent","d":"0","c":{"2":"Mexicans, Japanese & Italians"},"b":"Local white collar workers, business & professional men, artisans; farm, oil well, WPA workers.

This area consists of three subdivisions: Bel-Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Estates, all of which have been developed within the past 15 years in an orderly manner and under efficient sponsorship. This area represents, without question, the highest type of residential construction and maintenance in Los Angeles County. Homesites range in size to from 2 to 15 acres, which sell for from $7500-12500 per acre. Cost pf three recent improvements, including sites in Holmby Hills, were reported to be $80000, $100000, and $110000. It is noticeable that new construction is along conservative lines but represents the highest type of architectural skill. Extensive improvements of less pretentious character, in a price range of $25000-$35000, have taken place in Stone Canyon and tributary valleys in the past 3 years. Sales demand in the area is good. It should be borne in mind, however, that for sale purposes there is normally a high ratio of depreciation from cost prices in improvements of the mansion type.

Currently it is one of the “hot spots” of the community. Construction and maintenance are of excellent character. Architectural designs, particularly of new improvements, are individually attractive and harmonious as a whole. Population is homogeneous and show a high degree of neighborhood pride. Proximity to numerous motion picture studios, Country Clubs, and the Pacific Military Academy are considered favorable influences. The location is also a favorable one. Lot values range around $30 per front foot.

Land improved 60% of possible 85%. Deed restricted in part but provision loosely drawn. Zoning is mostly single-family with multi-family permitted in parts. Availability of conveniences varies with location, from fair to good. Development of this area, which began some 20 years ago, has been irregular, then distinct waves of activity having been experienced, the last of these beginning in 1936 under stimulus of FHA financing, has been the most intense and is still under way. This intermittent activity has resulted in a spotted and more or less inharmonious aspect. New construction is of much better quality than the old, being of standard quality or better. This has had the effect of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy and architectural designs are generally attractive. There are many scatter blocks located near arroyos or below steep hillsides where there are real flood or landslide hazards. However, well-conceived control projects have done much to minimize such dangers and in many cases such hazards are more mental than real. Las Encino’s Canyon properties have suffered most in the past from this menace. The area is an isolated one and, as has been indicated, is inclined to heterogeneity, and this is particularly true of the section west of Canada Blvd. The greatest activity has been in the northern part of the area and it is there that most of the multi-family structures are located.

The area is far-flung following to some extent a hilly section known as Monterey Hills. It is a popular district with those having business in Los Angeles, and its population to a great extent is made up of Los Angeles business and professional people. Construction ranges from standard to superstandard quality. Maintenance is of good character and in many cases mitigates age and obsolescence. Architectural designs of improvements are of great variety and this, together with a large variance in age, gives the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is fairly homogeneous, although there is a wide differential in incomes. The area contains many large old live oak trees which add to its charm and desirability. Conveniences to Los Angeles is one of the location’s chief attractions. While development has never been very active its growth has been quite steady and there are indications that its trend of desirability is still upward.

It is one of the oldest parts of Hollywood and was a very popular district at one time. The area is traversed by Highland Ave. and bounded on the east by Cahuenga Blvd. – two heavy traffic arteries – the latter protecting the area from the adverse influence of area D-28 to the east. Construction and maintenance are generally of good quality. Improvements are heterogeneous as to age, size and architectural design. Population, while harmonious, has a wide spread of income, with occupations ranging from better salaried white collar workers to wealthy business and professional men. The topography is uneven and spotted, the central portion is fairy level and balance of area is rolling with steep grades and rugged hills in spots. Proximity to Hollywood Bowl is a detrimental influence. This is an extremely difficult area to grade and there is a wide divergence of opinion among authorities familiar with the district.

Owing to age and heterogeneity, coupled with a distinct tendency toward multiple-family structures, the area is accorded a “low blue” grade.","9":{"1":"Whitley Heights","2":"2nd -","3":"B-70","4":"2-23-39"},"10":""}},"C76":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-118.3814,34.0661],[-118.3842,34.0665],[-118.3895,34.0665],[-118.3895,34.0651],[-118.3939,34.0651],[-118.394,34.0595],[-118.3892,34.0594],[-118.3894,34.0561],[-118.3894,34.0553],[-118.3963,34.0554],[-118.3991,34.0591],[-118.3999,34.0591],[-118.4,34.0649],[-118.4077,34.065],[-118.4078,34.0605],[-118.4033,34.0606],[-118.4033,34.0567],[-118.4009,34.0545],[-118.4028,34.0538],[-118.4107,34.0594],[-118.4089,34.06],[-118.4088,34.061],[-118.4106,34.0623],[-118.4136,34.0634],[-118.4143,34.0642],[-118.4106,34.0665],[-118.3955,34.0664],[-118.3955,34.0671],[-118.3874,34.0671],[-118.3874,34.0722],[-118.3847,34.0721],[-118.3847,34.0715],[-118.3826,34.0716],[-118.3826,34.0734],[-118.3762,34.0735],[-118.3762,34.0709],[-118.3816,34.0708],[-118.3814,34.0661]]]]},"labelCoords":[34.0633806640625,-118.3969470703125],"center":[34.063,-118.396],"boundingBox":[[34.054,-118.414],[34.074,-118.376]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.794,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/C76.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/C76/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/C76/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None apparent","d":"0","c":{"2":"--"},"b":"Professional and business men, retired capitalists, executives, etc. Income $5000-10,000 and up","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"85","2":"N/A","p":{"2":"N/A"},"o":{"2":"N/A"},"n":{"5":"N/A"},"m":{"4":"N/A"},"l":{"2":"N/A"},"k":{"2":"N/A"},"j":{"2":"N/A"},"i":{"5":"N/A"},"h":{"4":"N/A"},"g":{"2":"N/A"},"f":{"2":"N/A"},"e":{"2":"N/A"},"d":{"2":"N/A"},"c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":{"2":"N/A"},"a":{"2":"N/A"}},"3":{"1":"3","2":"8 rooms $11,000","3":"Owner built"},"4":{"b":"Few","a":"1"},"5":{"1":"3","b":"Few","a":"2"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"8-1939","2":"52.7"},"8":"Terrain: Level with favorable grades and no construction hazards.

The southeast section south of San Marion Ave. and east of 6th St. is the most choice part of area and was put on the market about 10 years ago but developed very slowly until 1937, but has grown rapidly since that time. This is a highly regarded district and, although it is inclined to be heterogeneous both as to population and improvements, it is considered as being still desirable as a place to live. Maintenance, while somewhat spotted, generally indicates pride of occupancy. Owing to its favorable location this is a good rental area. As a consequence a number of small multi-family structures have been built in the western section of area.

Hillside lot values are also higher. These factors account for the wide price spread shown above. Desirability shades off from west to east. Adjacent to the green areas to the north and west are favorable influences. Some of the older structures are over 10 years of age and construction is not of as good quality as later improvements.

This area is composed of subdivisions known as “Belmont Shores” and “Naples”, both being in the nature of high grade beach resort developments. However, there are an increasing number of permanent residences being built, and the area has been very active during the past 3 or 4 years. Construction is of high standard quality and maintenance is of good character. Architectural designs are generally attractive but undersized lots and irregular platting gives parts of area a crowded aspect. Owing to lack of uniformity in size, lot values are hard to estimate; based upon a 120 ft. depth they will probably range from $25 to $50, probably more for frontages on the Rivo Alto Canal, which are 30 ft. with little depth. In spite of shifting nature population gives the impression of homogeneity. Occupancy is irregular and changes with the seasons; for the same reason rentals are not constant and brackets shown above are only nominal and are upon a yearly lease basis. Across the Marine Stadium, which borders are on the northeast, are some producing oil wells, but they are apparently not considered a detrimental factor. This are will grade from “low” to “high blue” in different parts with spots showing a “yellow” tinge.

Improvements are heterogeneous as to type, size, age and maintenance, Population is inclined to be inharmonious. Since the area was cleared of ad valorem bonded debt some two years ago, there has been quite a little activity in the area largely under stimulus of FHA financing and new improvements are of very much better class. In the hatched portion of area are a number of pretentious homes of the country estate type which occupy spacious grounds. In time this area will undoubtedly have to be broken down into a number of smaller areas and regarded. In the meantime it is assigned a “medial” yellow grade.","9":{"1":"Tujunga-Sunland District","2":"3rd","3":"C-9","4":"4-3-39"},"10":"Caution: this area is currently affected in whole or in part by Ad valorem Tax District.

Schools are good and readily available, and church facilities are convenient. Up to 1905 this area was largely citrus groves, and development began by the purchase of these groves by eastern people for winter homes, who replaced the ranch homes with imposing mansions. This, by and large, is the pattern of the area. Many of the old being super standard. Maintenance, likewise, shows high pride of possession. Architectural designs, as well as landscaping, are individualists and add glamour to the district. This area gives evidence of having been the “melting pot” of the upper income brackets of the nation. This is indicated by the wholesale manner in which indigenous plant life of the various sections of our nation have been injected into the decorative features of those various estates. Horticultural and floricultural novelties of all sections of the nation have been introduced into the decorative scheme of the various holdings. The evergreens of the eastern seaboard and Pacific Northwest are particularly in evidence, and on New Year’s Eve, Santa Anita Avenue is a blaze with an electrical display from these evergreens which border that thoroughfare. There is, however indications of a transition in the area. While many original owners are still residents, properties are more and more passing into control of 2nd and 3rd generation owners. This is definitely suggested by the fact that within the past few years several of these old estates, which for various reasons, have become alienated from original owners, have been subdivided; the old mansions demolished and less pretentious structures and grounds have taken their place. This is particularly obvious in the district between Calaveras and Mariposa Sts. and Santa Anita and El Molino Aves. In this district at least one old estate has been subdivided and 20 new 5 to 7 room bungalows of modern design and extra standard construction have been erected on generous sized lots to take the place of the old improvements. Demolition of another original old mansion was observed in another part of the area. What this portended could not be learned, but there is no doubt that this district is in a transition period. If imagination were allowed full sway, based upon recent developments, a 1st grade might logically be assigned, based upon residential desirability over the next 10 or 15 years. However, the area as a whole gives no such optimistic indication and, based upon present definite prospects, it is thought that all that is justified is a grade of “high yellow” with the suggestion that a future survey will break the area down into several grades.","9":{"1":"Altadena","2":"3rd +","3":"C-25","4":"4-6-39"},"10":""}},"B5":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-118.3818,34.1568],[-118.3835,34.1568],[-118.3879,34.1568],[-118.3878,34.1523],[-118.3878,34.1504],[-118.3952,34.1505],[-118.3963,34.151],[-118.3971,34.1521],[-118.3976,34.1529],[-118.3975,34.1558],[-118.3921,34.1558],[-118.3922,34.1649],[-118.3877,34.1649],[-118.3877,34.1686],[-118.3842,34.1685],[-118.3835,34.1676],[-118.383,34.1667],[-118.3831,34.1657],[-118.3832,34.1651],[-118.3829,34.1642],[-118.3829,34.1626],[-118.3831,34.1615],[-118.3826,34.1603],[-118.3816,34.1588],[-118.3815,34.1578],[-118.3818,34.1568]]]]},"labelCoords":[34.160902734375,-118.38709726562499],"center":[34.159,-118.389],"boundingBox":[[34.15,-118.398],[34.169,-118.381]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.585,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/B5.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/B5/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/B5/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"of subversive racial elements a distinct threat","d":"0","c":{"2":"None subversive"},"b":"Small business and professional men, artisans, white collar workers.

Maintenance, while not of expensive character, indicates pride of occupancy. Improvements run from new to 40 years of age. Architectural designs, therefore, are of a wide range and gives the area a heterogeneous aspect. Population is generally homogeneous. Lot values are around $10 per front foot. This area, while old and poorly located, is not lacking in charm and is far from being a blighted area. It is accorded a “low yellow” grade.","9":{"1":"Herman","2":"3rd","3":"C-35","4":"4-11-39"},"10":""}},"B27":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-118.1752,34.1721],[-118.174,34.1665],[-118.1728,34.1609],[-118.1724,34.1609],[-118.1724,34.1605],[-118.1709,34.1574],[-118.173,34.1563],[-118.1746,34.1605],[-118.1766,34.1648],[-118.1801,34.1638],[-118.1833,34.1701],[-118.1825,34.1703],[-118.1816,34.1701],[-118.1807,34.1698],[-118.1802,34.1697],[-118.1802,34.1712],[-118.1818,34.1714],[-118.1833,34.1714],[-118.1843,34.1718],[-118.1849,34.1725],[-118.1854,34.1737],[-118.1854,34.1744],[-118.1851,34.175],[-118.1842,34.1752],[-118.1828,34.1751],[-118.1817,34.175],[-118.1813,34.1748],[-118.1809,34.1749],[-118.1814,34.1754],[-118.1813,34.1758],[-118.18,34.176],[-118.1789,34.1763],[-118.1778,34.1768],[-118.177,34.1771],[-118.1763,34.1776],[-118.176,34.1786],[-118.1759,34.1795],[-118.1759,34.18],[-118.1755,34.1803],[-118.1749,34.1805],[-118.1744,34.1805],[-118.1744,34.1803],[-118.1746,34.1801],[-118.1742,34.1795],[-118.1738,34.1789],[-118.1737,34.1784],[-118.1738,34.1779],[-118.174,34.1773],[-118.1745,34.1768],[-118.1749,34.1763],[-118.175,34.1754],[-118.1749,34.1742],[-118.1752,34.1731],[-118.1752,34.1721]]]]},"labelCoords":[34.16779804687499,-118.177640234375],"center":[34.17,-118.178],"boundingBox":[[34.156,-118.185],[34.181,-118.171]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.481,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/B27.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/B27/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/B27/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None apparent","d":"0","c":{"2":"None subversive"},"b":"Retired, public employees, white collar workers and skilled artisans.

This is a new subdivision recently placed on the market by the Huntington Land and Improvement Co., who originally purchased it for a short interurban route from Pasadena to Los Angeles. This route was discarded and it lay dormant as a swampy tract until it was included in a WPA project, cleared and drained. (How this was accomplished was not researched). After this improvement the area was platted and placed upon the market as a high grade “commuters” subdivision. Under the stimulus of promotional effort and FHA Title II financing, great progress has been made in its development. Construction runs from standard or better grade. Architectural designs are individually attractive and harmonious as a whole. Population bids fair to be homogeneous. Owing to the convenience of the location to the new Los Angeles City Civic Center the area is a popular one City, County, State and Federal employees. Land values are not stabilized but run from $10 to $15 per front foot. Because of the speculative nature of the enterprise and low ownership equity provided by FHA financing, coupled with the fact that it is engulfed by an old district of lower grade (El Sereto), it is thought that this area has already passed its peak of desirability and is therefore accorded a “high yellow” grade.","9":{"1":"Huntington Villa Los Angeles","2":"3rd","3":"C-36","4":"4/11/39"},"10":""}},"D6":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-118.1552,34.1788],[-118.1552,34.1731],[-118.1514,34.1727],[-118.1511,34.1729],[-118.1495,34.1726],[-118.1493,34.167],[-118.1492,34.1618],[-118.1479,34.1618],[-118.1479,34.1609],[-118.1449,34.1608],[-118.1448,34.1614],[-118.1426,34.1614],[-118.1426,34.1579],[-118.151,34.1578],[-118.151,34.1581],[-118.1546,34.156],[-118.1549,34.1554],[-118.1584,34.1534],[-118.1598,34.1527],[-118.1595,34.1537],[-118.1595,34.154],[-118.1592,34.1547],[-118.1597,34.1552],[-118.1605,34.1561],[-118.161,34.1567],[-118.1612,34.1578],[-118.1611,34.1585],[-118.1609,34.1592],[-118.1605,34.1591],[-118.1593,34.1611],[-118.1596,34.1619],[-118.1586,34.1632],[-118.1572,34.1625],[-118.1561,34.1639],[-118.1561,34.1657],[-118.1574,34.1659],[-118.1571,34.169],[-118.1571,34.1724],[-118.1608,34.173],[-118.1611,34.1664],[-118.1598,34.1662],[-118.1599,34.1649],[-118.1609,34.1636],[-118.1603,34.1626],[-118.1609,34.1615],[-118.1648,34.1673],[-118.1643,34.1692],[-118.1655,34.1694],[-118.1655,34.1743],[-118.1595,34.1736],[-118.1595,34.1756],[-118.1595,34.179],[-118.1589,34.179],[-118.1589,34.181],[-118.1552,34.181],[-118.1552,34.1788]]]]},"labelCoords":[34.168354296874995,-118.15324492187499],"center":[34.166,-118.155],"boundingBox":[[34.153,-118.166],[34.181,-118.143]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":1.005,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/D6.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/D6/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/D6/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Both Mexican and Negro population increasing","d":"40","c":{"2":"Mexicans and Japanese"},"b":"Servants, service workers, artisans and WPA workers.

Population is inclined to be heterogeneous, and while owner occupancy is high, equities average so low as to threaten the economic stability of the area. Practically all improvements are being constructed by speculative builders whose profits are said to be largely derived from arbitrary increase in land prices. Sales are being effected by “high pressure” methods and there is evidence of increasing sales resistance, as many completed dwellings remain unsold.

Maintenance, however, is generally of better quality than might be expected and indicates a pride of occupancy. Population is of mixed character. The average front foot value of lots is around $30. There is a certain charm in the location of this area and the combination of mountain and seashore atmosphere is attractive to many people. There is evidence of an upward trend in the area, which might be termed the renaissance of a beach resort or summer colony neighborhood. It is upon this basis that the area is accorded a “low yellow” grade.","9":{"1":"Santa Monica and Rustic Canyons","2":"3rd -","3":"C-61","4":"3/6/39"},"10":""}},"C44":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-118.0458,34.1206],[-118.0501,34.1205],[-118.055,34.1204],[-118.0554,34.122],[-118.0553,34.1234],[-118.0582,34.123],[-118.0597,34.1228],[-118.0597,34.1235],[-118.0642,34.1228],[-118.0645,34.1247],[-118.0673,34.1243],[-118.0673,34.1259],[-118.0673,34.1268],[-118.0673,34.1271],[-118.0673,34.1271],[-118.0673,34.1281],[-118.0673,34.1295],[-118.0673,34.1308],[-118.0595,34.1312],[-118.0591,34.1312],[-118.0545,34.1316],[-118.0546,34.1295],[-118.0489,34.1297],[-118.0488,34.1296],[-118.0488,34.1277],[-118.0459,34.1279],[-118.0459,34.1252],[-118.0459,34.1244],[-118.0459,34.1236],[-118.0459,34.1229],[-118.0459,34.1217],[-118.0458,34.1206]],[[-118.0541,34.127],[-118.0541,34.128],[-118.0556,34.128],[-118.0558,34.1271],[-118.0558,34.1266],[-118.0575,34.1265],[-118.0575,34.1252],[-118.0559,34.1254],[-118.056,34.1241],[-118.0544,34.1242],[-118.0543,34.1256],[-118.0529,34.1257],[-118.053,34.1269],[-118.0539,34.1268],[-118.0541,34.127]]]]},"labelCoords":[34.126,-118.056],"center":[34.126,-118.056],"boundingBox":[[34.12,-118.067],[34.132,-118.046]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.646,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/C44.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/C44/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/C44/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None apparent","d":"0","c":{"2":"-"},"b":"Retired and professional people.

Land improved 30% of the 60% available for building sites. There are no deeds restrictions nor zoning; however, are terrain and isolation protective elements. Transportation limited to private automobiles. Free bus service to public schools. Churches, trading and amusement centers are remote, the nearest being Westwood Village. Originally opened up some 14 or 16 years ago as a small “cabin” type project. This area has improved considerably in the past few years and new construction is now more pretentious and of much better quality. In consequence the area is extremely heterogeneous, improvements varying from two-room cabins and shacks to new modern 6 and 7 room bungalows. There are very few improved streets and the majority shown on the map are non-existent and are topographically impossible. Platting has been largely arbitrary, contours being followed as improvements were made. In this respect lack of restrictions has been a decided detriment. Beverly Glen Blvd., the principal thoroughfare, is a through trunk highway, and well-traveled, but is narrow and winding with a number of steep grades. Lot values run from $500 to $650. Realtors state that competition of FHA Title I financing has adversely affected both price and rental values. This area, in common with other canyon developments, faces the hazards of fire, floods and steep grades. Ample forestation, coupled with rustic scenic beauty, lend charm to the neighborhood. These natural advantages, together with prospect of a favorable development of adjacent mountainous section, constitute elements distinctly favorable to the future of the area. Under the circumstances it is felt that only a “provisional yellow” grade should be accorded.","9":{"1":"Beverly Glen","2":"Provisional 3rd","3":"C-69","4":"3/1/39"},"10":"Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District.

The increasing concentration of Jewish families is said to be a derogatory influence and this, together with the predominance of multi-family dwellings, leads to the conclusion that the area should not be accorded higher than a “low yellow” grade.","9":{"1":"Beverly to Melrose Gardner to Edinburgh","2":"3rd -","3":"C-81","4":"2/24/39"},"10":""}},"C53":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-117.8159,34.1116],[-117.8103,34.1116],[-117.8103,34.1138],[-117.8072,34.1138],[-117.8072,34.1074],[-117.8081,34.1075],[-117.808,34.1068],[-117.8092,34.1068],[-117.8093,34.1074],[-117.8102,34.1074],[-117.8102,34.1068],[-117.8124,34.1069],[-117.8124,34.1074],[-117.8143,34.1075],[-117.8144,34.108],[-117.816,34.1081],[-117.8159,34.1116]]]]},"labelCoords":[34.1093703125,-117.8113515625],"center":[34.11,-117.811],"boundingBox":[[34.107,-117.816],[34.114,-117.807]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.174,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/full-size/C53.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/C53/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/LosAngeles/1939/C53/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/LosAngeles/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"of subversive racial elements and encroachment of business a threat.","d":"0","c":{"2":"None subversive known"},"b":"Business and professional men, white collar workers, radio and movie employees, etc. Income $1800-$3000 and up","a":{"3":"N/A"}},"2":{"1":"80","2":"20","p":{"2":"N/A"},"o":{"2":"N/A"},"n":{"5":"N/A"},"m":{"4":"N/A"},"l":{"2":"N/A"},"k":{"2":"N/A"},"j":{"2":"N/A"},"i":{"5":"N/A"},"h":{"4":"N/A"},"g":{"2":"N/A"},"f":{"2":"N/A"},"e":{"2":"N/A"},"d":{"2":"N/A"},"c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":{"2":"Large old 5%"},"a":{"2":"Multi-family dwellings 15%"}},"3":{"1":"15","2":"From single to multi-family $6000-$30000","3":"Owner built"},"4":{"b":"Many","a":"2"},"5":{"1":"3","b":"Many","a":"10"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"1938-9","2":"52.7"},"8":"Terrain: Level with favorable grades and no construction hazards.

Owing to its very favorable location, when deed restrictions began to expire some 10 years ago, multi-family structures began to appear. The transition from an exclusive single-family neighborhood to a residential income district is proceeding in such an orderly manner and the new structures are so nearly in keeping with the neighborhood that there has been a minimum disturbance of single-family residential values. These multiple housing structures are said to be the most uniform and well-built in the city. The area is surrounded by major arterials upon which outlying business establishments are located. Third Ave., which traverses the area, while not a business street, is an arterial thoroughfare and a traffic hazard.

Originally, dwellings were largely built and owned by the company but, consistent with the policy of encouraging employees to live near its industrial activities, home ownership has gradually increased. The community suffered but little from “depression ills”, nor has it been greatly influenced by past depression building activity, although it is approved territory for FHA financing.

In country territory zoning is inadequate. Regardless of zoning, improvements are 90% single family dwellings. Conveniences are all available in varying degrees. Some street improvements and sewers are lacking in southern portion. This large far flung district varies in age from 25 years or more between Slauson and Florence Avenues to new development from Imperial Highway to Los Angeles County line. There are many old structures scattered throughout which give the area a spotted and heterogeneous aspect. There are many blocks, however, which are uniform as to southwestern part where pattern has not been definitely established. There were many foreclosures in this area during the depression period and the HOLC Veterans’ Welfare Board and other large mortgage institutions at one time owned a large amount of acquirements. These have now, however, been largely liquidated. The area is predominantly workingman’s district and there are numerous duplexes, four family flats and bungalow courts scattered throughout. There is a threat of subversive racial infiltration (Negroes largely) in the southeast portion of area. An attempt was made to break this area down, but it is in a transition period at present, and it was not feasible. However, it is believed that in the course of time it will be necessary that this be done and will result in a number of areas grading from “low blue” to 4th grade. A large amount of FHA financing has recently taken place in the area and has had the effect of greatly increasing home ownership and strengthening its grade. Much of the southwest portion of the area occupies County territory which further confuses the situation. Construction ranges from low to good standard quality. Maintenance is generally fair. Both population and improvements, however, are heterogeneous.

Most streets are improved but are generally short dead-end thoroughfares emanating from Linda Vista Avenue. This area was originally a chicken ranch district, and its transition to a residential section began about 1925. Street and other improvements were financed through an issue of Ad valorem Tax Bonds, popularly known as Mattoon District Bonds. This indebtedness in conjunction with the depression retarded development, and it was not until the bond issue was refunded and the advent of the FHA that activity was resumed. Population, improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are all of a heterogeneous character. Many of the old 4 and 5 room ranch type bungalows are still in existence and in spite of many new well-constructed dwellings they give the area a spotted appearance. Distance from conveniences, poor transportation facilities and lack of deed restrictions are also unfavorable factors. Favorable influences are: large number of high grade improvements, rapid increase of better quality inhabitants, and indications of continuance of building activity.
