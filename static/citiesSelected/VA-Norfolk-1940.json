residences of substantial construction on good sized lots. Water front sites are the most desirable. A bridge at Willow Wood Drive connects the area with Belvedere (B-7), from which point 20 minute transportation by street car is afforded to downtown Norfolk. Willow Wood Drive is the only through street and there is little through traffic in the area. All city facilities are available except gas. Streets are in good condition but poorly lighted, a fault common with all Norfolk neighborhoods. There is good pride of home ownership evidenced in the maintenance of lawns and shrubbery and the population is stable.

A level area approximately 70% built up. It is park like in general appearance. Many of the streets are winding and attractive, but all are poorly lighted, which is a common fault in all Norfolk neighborhoods. The central portion of the area, known as Glencove, is the principal scene of present construction activity. A special assessment has been agreed upon for this area in consideration of street improvements, which will expire in 1946. All construction is sound and the population is stable, with excellent pride of home ownership evident in the maintenance of lawns and shrubbory. Hampton Boulevard, through the center of the area, is a thoroughfare to the Naval Operating Base and the Newport News ferry. There are several apartment houses on this street, of three and four room suites renting from $45 to $50 per unit per month, and a street car line which takes about 25 minutes to downtown Norfolk.

Some parts of the area are low and wet, due to numerous inlets from the Elizabeth River. However, these inlets afford opportunities for boating and other recreation and are therefore a desirable feature for some people. There is little or no water in most of these creeks at low tide and they then present a muddy and unsightly appearance. A majority of the lots in the built up section are 30 x 120 feet.

Houses are of standard construction and the population is stable, but age and obsolescence as well as the location which is not in line of Norfolk's growth, preclude the classification of the area as desirable in its future trend.","9":{"1":"Estabrook (Norfolk County)","2":"3rd","3":"C-29","4":"Dec. 1939"}}},"C28":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-76.2383,36.8967],[-76.2362,36.89],[-76.2376,36.8896],[-76.2392,36.8893],[-76.241,36.8877],[-76.2418,36.8869],[-76.2426,36.8862],[-76.2437,36.8852],[-76.2446,36.8846],[-76.2453,36.8841],[-76.2465,36.8852],[-76.2474,36.8862],[-76.2478,36.8869],[-76.2482,36.8886],[-76.2484,36.8892],[-76.2483,36.8893],[-76.2482,36.8896],[-76.2484,36.8899],[-76.2485,36.89],[-76.2483,36.8901],[-76.248,36.8903],[-76.2483,36.8905],[-76.2485,36.8905],[-76.2496,36.8905],[-76.2504,36.8908],[-76.2505,36.8914],[-76.2502,36.8918],[-76.2497,36.8923],[-76.2489,36.8925],[-76.2481,36.8923],[-76.2476,36.8926],[-76.2466,36.8926],[-76.2461,36.8926],[-76.2457,36.8925],[-76.2449,36.8923],[-76.2439,36.8923],[-76.2431,36.8924],[-76.243,36.8924],[-76.2423,36.8923],[-76.2422,36.8924],[-76.2415,36.8928],[-76.2404,36.8934],[-76.2404,36.8938],[-76.2405,36.8945],[-76.2405,36.8952],[-76.2403,36.8959],[-76.2398,36.8964],[-76.239,36.8966],[-76.2383,36.8967]]]]},"labelCoords":[36.88887421875,-76.24474140625],"center":[36.89,-76.243],"boundingBox":[[36.884,-76.251],[36.897,-76.236]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.301,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/full-size/C28.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/C28/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/C28/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"none","d":"0%","c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":"Clerks - mechanics, $1,200","a":{"3":"N/A"}},"2":{"1":"100%","2":"N/A","p":{"2":"N/A"},"o":{"2":"N/A"},"n":{"5":"N/A"},"m":{"4":"N/A"},"l":{"2":"N/A"},"k":{"2":"N/A"},"j":{"2":"N/A"},"i":{"5":"N/A"},"h":{"4":"N/A"},"g":{"2":"N/A"},"f":{"2":"N/A"},"e":{"2":"N/A"},"d":{"2":"N/A"},"c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":{"2":"N/A"},"a":{"2":"N/A"}},"3":{"1":"20","2":"Bungalows, $3,500","3":"moderately"},"4":{"b":"5","a":"0"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"5","a":"0"},"6":"FHA","7":{"1":"9","2":"$20.00"},"8":"An outlying level area near the Norfolk City line about 50% developed with small houses of fair construction.

Age and obsolescence preclude a better classification than that of a desirable residential neighborhood, but it will probably continue to enjoy its present stability due to the high character, wealth and position of many of the inhabitants.","9":{"1":"Beechwood Place (Norfolk)","2":"2nd","3":"B-12","4":"Dec. 1939"}}},"D4":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-76.3014,36.8581],[-76.3028,36.8563],[-76.3052,36.8572],[-76.3051,36.8575],[-76.3051,36.8579],[-76.3053,36.8581],[-76.3055,36.8583],[-76.3065,36.8585],[-76.3069,36.8603],[-76.306,36.8616],[-76.3049,36.8631],[-76.3022,36.8617],[-76.3032,36.8604],[-76.3017,36.8598],[-76.3026,36.8585],[-76.3014,36.8581]]]]},"labelCoords":[36.8599953125,-76.30492343749998],"center":[36.86,-76.304],"boundingBox":[[36.856,-76.307],[36.863,-76.301]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.083,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/full-size/D4.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/D4/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/D4/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Whites moving to area D-3.

St. and is 100% built up. The upper portion, about 40% built up, is known as Ellsworth and Cromwell. While Belvedere has a very desirable appearance, it is unworthy of the best classification for the reason that most of the houses have been built with very low foundations with insufficient ventilation to dry out foundation timbers, which gives rise to possible difficulties from dampness and termites. The resulting sales resistance has caused the developers to offer the houses either for sale or for rent furnished or unfurnished and this has attracted such people as those temporarily attached to the Naval Operating Base and other transient families, so that the population is comparatively unstable. A somewhat better class of construction prevails in Cromwell and Ellsworth. The development is well planned, parklike in appearance and attractively landscaped. Most streets are winding and there are few sidewalks. The streets are poorly lighted, a fault common in all Norfolk neighborhoods. No sewers have been installed, but the area has all other city facilities. Lots are ample in size, many being 75 by 150 feet, and the waterfront sites are the most desirable. Schools, churches and neighborhood stores are convenient, and 20 minute transportation to downtown Norfolk is available on Granby Street.","9":{"1":"Belvedere (Norfolk)","2":"2nd","3":"B-7","4":"Dec. 1939"}}},"D6":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-76.2675,36.8663],[-76.2673,36.8661],[-76.2669,36.8662],[-76.2667,36.8662],[-76.2669,36.8665],[-76.2673,36.8668],[-76.2674,36.8672],[-76.2672,36.8675],[-76.2668,36.8676],[-76.2664,36.8676],[-76.2662,36.8672],[-76.2658,36.867],[-76.2653,36.8668],[-76.2647,36.8665],[-76.2642,36.8662],[-76.2639,36.866],[-76.2638,36.8657],[-76.264,36.8654],[-76.2642,36.8653],[-76.2644,36.8651],[-76.2645,36.8648],[-76.2643,36.8644],[-76.2642,36.8641],[-76.2641,36.8636],[-76.2637,36.864],[-76.2638,36.8643],[-76.2635,36.8649],[-76.2634,36.8651],[-76.263,36.8652],[-76.2626,36.865],[-76.2619,36.8648],[-76.2616,36.8644],[-76.2616,36.864],[-76.2615,36.8636],[-76.2614,36.8632],[-76.2621,36.863],[-76.2625,36.8629],[-76.2627,36.8626],[-76.2627,36.8623],[-76.2624,36.8619],[-76.2623,36.8616],[-76.2621,36.8612],[-76.2622,36.8607],[-76.2624,36.8604],[-76.2627,36.86],[-76.2611,36.8597],[-76.2619,36.8583],[-76.263,36.8564],[-76.2639,36.8547],[-76.2639,36.8546],[-76.2644,36.8537],[-76.2648,36.8533],[-76.2662,36.8516],[-76.2709,36.8531],[-76.2723,36.8536],[-76.272,36.8542],[-76.2703,36.8574],[-76.269,36.857],[-76.2678,36.8567],[-76.2673,36.8577],[-76.2659,36.8603],[-76.2699,36.8609],[-76.2703,36.8602],[-76.2716,36.8579],[-76.2743,36.8587],[-76.2735,36.8603],[-76.2731,36.8606],[-76.2723,36.8611],[-76.2716,36.8619],[-76.2713,36.8626],[-76.2708,36.8636],[-76.2701,36.8651],[-76.2684,36.8683],[-76.2682,36.8682],[-76.268,36.8677],[-76.2679,36.8673],[-76.2679,36.867],[-76.2677,36.8666],[-76.2675,36.8663]]]]},"labelCoords":[36.86330468749998,-76.26692656249999],"center":[36.86,-76.267],"boundingBox":[[36.852,-76.274],[36.868,-76.261]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.421,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/full-size/D6.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/D6/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/D6/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"none","d":"100%","c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":"Laborers - farm workers $600-1,000","a":{"3":"N/A"}},"2":{"1":"90%","2":"N/A","p":{"2":"N/A"},"o":{"2":"N/A"},"n":{"5":"N/A"},"m":{"4":"N/A"},"l":{"2":"N/A"},"k":{"2":"N/A"},"j":{"2":"N/A"},"i":{"5":"N/A"},"h":{"4":"N/A"},"g":{"2":"N/A"},"f":{"2":"N/A"},"e":{"2":"N/A"},"d":{"2":"N/A"},"c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":{"2":"N/A"},"a":{"2":"N/A"}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"N/A","3":"N/A"},"4":{"b":"50","a":"10 - $23,400"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"50","a":"20 - $36,500"},"6":"very limited","7":{"1":"9","2":"$25.00"},"8":"A level area approximately 50% built up. Sparsely settled in the northern portion where there is a vity dump and an unsightly waterfront. Many of the residents are employed by farmers in the outlying sections and there is some industry scattered through the area, particularly adjacent to the railroad tracks, which also afford opportunities for employments. Houses are small, of mediocre construction, mixed in type and generally of poor appearance. No pride of home ownership is evident. 75% of streets are dirt surfaced, full of ruts and mud holes. Many houses are in a dilapidated condition and have been abandoned. Vandalism is prevalent. Collections difficult. A considerable amount of demolition has taken place in the last five years. Several cemeteries adjacent to the area on the east, and railroad tracks run through the section. There is a large negro grade school and high school at E. Princess Anne Road and Marshall Ave. A somewhat better type of negro families live near the school. Principal thoroughfares are Chapel Street, Maltby Ave., and E. Princess Anne Road.","9":{"1":"Cottage Heights and Douglas Park (Norfolk)","2":"4th","3":"D-6","4":"Nov. 1939"}}},"C1":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-76.2915,36.9678],[-76.2905,36.9677],[-76.2894,36.9677],[-76.2884,36.9677],[-76.2875,36.9677],[-76.2871,36.9677],[-76.2866,36.9677],[-76.285,36.9678],[-76.284,36.9679],[-76.2828,36.968],[-76.2823,36.9681],[-76.2818,36.9681],[-76.2806,36.968],[-76.2796,36.9679],[-76.278,36.9677],[-76.2766,36.9674],[-76.2754,36.967],[-76.2741,36.9665],[-76.273,36.9661],[-76.2721,36.9658],[-76.2706,36.9651],[-76.2691,36.9644],[-76.2684,36.9641],[-76.2674,36.9637],[-76.2667,36.9633],[-76.2658,36.9627],[-76.2644,36.962],[-76.2634,36.9612],[-76.2619,36.9604],[-76.2607,36.9596],[-76.2594,36.959],[-76.261,36.9573],[-76.2635,36.955],[-76.2644,36.9556],[-76.2641,36.956],[-76.2638,36.9567],[-76.2639,36.957],[-76.2639,36.9581],[-76.264,36.9586],[-76.2643,36.9589],[-76.2651,36.9591],[-76.2662,36.9598],[-76.2668,36.9606],[-76.2673,36.9612],[-76.2676,36.9617],[-76.268,36.9619],[-76.2686,36.962],[-76.2692,36.9619],[-76.27,36.9617],[-76.2706,36.9617],[-76.2715,36.9619],[-76.2717,36.9622],[-76.272,36.9626],[-76.2723,36.9629],[-76.2726,36.9631],[-76.2732,36.963],[-76.2742,36.9626],[-76.275,36.9626],[-76.2757,36.9626],[-76.2766,36.9629],[-76.2784,36.9635],[-76.2793,36.9637],[-76.2804,36.9637],[-76.2822,36.9638],[-76.2833,36.9639],[-76.2847,36.9638],[-76.2847,36.9638],[-76.2862,36.9636],[-76.2872,36.9631],[-76.2887,36.9627],[-76.289,36.9626],[-76.2896,36.9624],[-76.2902,36.9626],[-76.2907,36.9628],[-76.2915,36.963],[-76.292,36.9634],[-76.2923,36.9639],[-76.2926,36.964],[-76.2929,36.9638],[-76.2932,36.9638],[-76.2934,36.9641],[-76.2939,36.964],[-76.2943,36.9642],[-76.2946,36.9645],[-76.295,36.9647],[-76.2953,36.9651],[-76.2958,36.9653],[-76.2962,36.9655],[-76.2964,36.9655],[-76.2967,36.9655],[-76.297,36.9653],[-76.2973,36.965],[-76.2973,36.9647],[-76.2975,36.9643],[-76.2977,36.9639],[-76.2977,36.9636],[-76.2979,36.9632],[-76.2981,36.9629],[-76.2984,36.9626],[-76.2986,36.9632],[-76.2985,36.964],[-76.2982,36.9648],[-76.2981,36.9658],[-76.2978,36.9664],[-76.2974,36.9673],[-76.2973,36.9679],[-76.297,36.9684],[-76.2963,36.9686],[-76.2954,36.9687],[-76.2952,36.9685],[-76.2944,36.9683],[-76.2935,36.968],[-76.2928,36.9679],[-76.2919,36.9678],[-76.2915,36.9678]]]]},"labelCoords":[36.965114453125,-76.28955585937497],"center":[36.964,-76.28],"boundingBox":[[36.955,-76.299],[36.969,-76.259]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.563,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/full-size/C1.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/C1/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/C1/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"none","d":"0%","c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":"Navy personnel - merchants - clerks $1,500-3,000","a":{"3":"N/A"}},"2":{"1":"95%","2":"N/A","p":{"2":"N/A"},"o":{"2":"N/A"},"n":{"5":"N/A"},"m":{"4":"N/A"},"l":{"2":"N/A"},"k":{"2":"N/A"},"j":{"2":"N/A"},"f":{"2":"N/A"},"e":{"2":"N/A"},"d":{"2":"N/A"},"c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":{"2":"N/A"},"a":{"2":"N/A"},"i":{"5":"N/A"},"h":{"4":"N/A"},"g":{"2":"N/A"}},"3":{"1":"12","2":"bungalows, $3,500-4,000","3":"fair - some built to rent"},"4":{"b":"15","a":"0"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"10","a":"8 - $26,200"},"6":"limited","7":{"1":"9","2":"$25.00"},"8":"This is a long narrow strip of land at the northern extremity of Norfolk, approximately 50% built up. Ocean View Ave. is the principal thoroughfare and leads to the Old Point Comfort ferry. Occupancy and the demand for rental units is very much improved in summer months. 35 minute transportation is afforded by street car to downtown Norfolk. Few streets other than the principal thoroughfare are paved and all are poorly lighted, a fault common with all Norfolk neighborhoods. Many of the structures on Ocean View Ave. are small hotels and summer boarding houses. The terrain is higher toward the western end but at the narrowest point toward the east it is low and flooded at times with high tide is accompanied by a strong northeast wind, thus entirely cutting off the section until ebb tide. THere are a few small developments of good character, but the area as a whole is remote, sparsely settled, treeless and unlikely to develop a homogeneous desirable neighborhood.","9":{"1":"Willoughby Spit (Norfolk)","2":"Low 3rd","3":"C-1","4":"Dec. 1939"}}},"D10":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-76.2851,36.8368],[-76.285,36.8367],[-76.2848,36.8367],[-76.2821,36.836],[-76.2823,36.8355],[-76.2832,36.8335],[-76.2839,36.8322],[-76.2857,36.8326],[-76.2857,36.8322],[-76.2862,36.8312],[-76.2869,36.8304],[-76.2877,36.8297],[-76.2882,36.8294],[-76.2887,36.8291],[-76.2893,36.8289],[-76.2901,36.8334],[-76.2901,36.8334],[-76.2897,36.8335],[-76.2895,36.8337],[-76.29,36.8343],[-76.2907,36.8353],[-76.289,36.8367],[-76.2885,36.837],[-76.2875,36.8376],[-76.2863,36.8384],[-76.286,36.8377],[-76.2854,36.8375],[-76.2852,36.8371],[-76.2851,36.8368]]]]},"labelCoords":[36.8348796875,-76.2870046875],"center":[36.834,-76.287],"boundingBox":[[36.829,-76.291],[36.838,-76.282]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.163,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/full-size/D10.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/D10/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/D10/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"none","d":"1%","c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":"laborers - merchants, $800","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"100%","2":"N/A","p":{"2":"N/A"},"o":{"2":"N/A"},"n":{"5":"N/A"},"m":{"4":"N/A"},"l":{"2":"N/A"},"k":{"2":"N/A"},"j":{"2":"N/A"},"i":{"5":"N/A"},"h":{"4":"N/A"},"g":{"2":"N/A"},"f":{"2":"N/A"},"e":{"2":"N/A"},"d":{"2":"N/A"},"c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":{"2":"N/A"},"a":{"2":"N/A"}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"N/A","3":"N/A"},"4":{"b":"15","a":"3 - $7,200"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"10","a":"0"},"6":"none","7":{"1":"9","2":"$25.00"},"8":"A level area approximately 25% built up.

level, and approximately 50% built up. It is fairly well developed in its eastern portion around Hampton Blvd., which is a thoroughfare to the Naval Operating Base and the Newport News ferry. The extreme western portion is now sparsely settled, although there are a number of large old houses and estates along the water front. Transportation is available by street car and bus approximately 20 minutes to down town Norfolk. Schools, churches and neighborhood stores are convenient. Existing construction is sound and the population is stable. Practically all of the water front, which borders three sides of the area, is desirable. Streets are hard surfaced but poorly lighted, which is a common fault with all Norfolk neighborhoods. There is a U.S. Government hospital at the northern end of Hampton Blvd. and at the southern boundary there is a new apartment group containing 172 units and renting for approximately $15.00 per room per month, although some units are rented furnished at a higher figure. The Norfolk branch of William and Mary College is near by and an athletic stadium known as Foreman Field is adjacent. Certain parts of the area are subject to a special assessment which has been agreed upon in consideration of street improvements, and will expire in 1944. Although a few new houses are being built in various parts of the area; it has generally reached the peak of its desirability and due to general age and obsolescence is not worthy of the highest grade.","9":{"1":"Larchmont (Norfolk)","2":"2nd","3":"B-6","4":"Dec. 1939"}}},"C12":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-76.2562,36.8814],[-76.2527,36.8775],[-76.2524,36.8776],[-76.2523,36.8771],[-76.2519,36.8755],[-76.2485,36.8618],[-76.2554,36.8581],[-76.2559,36.8584],[-76.2562,36.8589],[-76.256,36.8594],[-76.256,36.8599],[-76.2563,36.8601],[-76.2564,36.8606],[-76.2565,36.8611],[-76.2567,36.8616],[-76.2561,36.8619],[-76.2558,36.8616],[-76.2554,36.8614],[-76.255,36.8611],[-76.2545,36.8608],[-76.2545,36.8609],[-76.2548,36.8611],[-76.2551,36.8615],[-76.255,36.8618],[-76.2555,36.8619],[-76.2563,36.8621],[-76.2568,36.8624],[-76.2575,36.863],[-76.2582,36.8635],[-76.2586,36.8641],[-76.2585,36.8645],[-76.2581,36.8647],[-76.2576,36.8648],[-76.2571,36.8646],[-76.2566,36.8645],[-76.2561,36.8646],[-76.2562,36.8649],[-76.2556,36.8649],[-76.2554,36.8647],[-76.2549,36.8645],[-76.2547,36.8645],[-76.2541,36.8644],[-76.2537,36.8644],[-76.2533,36.8642],[-76.2527,36.864],[-76.2524,36.864],[-76.2527,36.8643],[-76.2532,36.8647],[-76.2537,36.8648],[-76.2544,36.8649],[-76.2549,36.8652],[-76.2552,36.8656],[-76.2555,36.8656],[-76.256,36.8654],[-76.2563,36.8653],[-76.2572,36.865],[-76.2577,36.865],[-76.258,36.865],[-76.2588,36.8649],[-76.2594,36.865],[-76.2598,36.8653],[-76.2599,36.8655],[-76.2597,36.8659],[-76.2595,36.8664],[-76.2592,36.8669],[-76.2591,36.8672],[-76.2587,36.8677],[-76.2587,36.8679],[-76.2589,36.8679],[-76.2591,36.8676],[-76.2595,36.8671],[-76.2598,36.8666],[-76.2601,36.8662],[-76.2605,36.8658],[-76.2611,36.8655],[-76.2617,36.8655],[-76.2617,36.8655],[-76.2624,36.8652],[-76.2628,36.8658],[-76.2631,36.8665],[-76.2633,36.8669],[-76.2635,36.8671],[-76.2639,36.8673],[-76.2641,36.8674],[-76.2645,36.8673],[-76.265,36.8675],[-76.2651,36.8682],[-76.2651,36.8687],[-76.2652,36.8688],[-76.2653,36.8687],[-76.2655,36.8682],[-76.2658,36.8679],[-76.2663,36.8677],[-76.2665,36.8678],[-76.2669,36.8679],[-76.267,36.8684],[-76.2669,36.8687],[-76.2669,36.8689],[-76.2668,36.8693],[-76.2669,36.8697],[-76.2672,36.8699],[-76.2675,36.8696],[-76.2675,36.8693],[-76.2676,36.8689],[-76.2678,36.8684],[-76.2681,36.8683],[-76.2684,36.8686],[-76.2685,36.869],[-76.2684,36.8696],[-76.2687,36.8699],[-76.2693,36.8703],[-76.2698,36.8707],[-76.2703,36.8709],[-76.2708,36.8711],[-76.271,36.8715],[-76.2715,36.8725],[-76.2716,36.8729],[-76.2718,36.873],[-76.2715,36.873],[-76.2713,36.873],[-76.2712,36.873],[-76.2709,36.873],[-76.2706,36.873],[-76.2702,36.8731],[-76.2699,36.8733],[-76.2696,36.8735],[-76.2695,36.8736],[-76.2694,36.8738],[-76.2693,36.8738],[-76.2693,36.8738],[-76.2692,36.8739],[-76.2688,36.8738],[-76.2684,36.8737],[-76.2681,36.8736],[-76.2677,36.8735],[-76.2673,36.8735],[-76.267,36.8734],[-76.2665,36.8733],[-76.2661,36.8732],[-76.2659,36.8733],[-76.2658,36.8734],[-76.2656,36.8737],[-76.2639,36.8778],[-76.2636,36.8785],[-76.2633,36.8791],[-76.2625,36.8789],[-76.26,36.8783],[-76.2586,36.8819],[-76.2579,36.8819],[-76.2568,36.8821],[-76.2562,36.8814]]]]},"labelCoords":[36.8733451171875,-76.2571919921875],"center":[36.871,-76.258],"boundingBox":[[36.858,-76.272],[36.882,-76.248]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.996,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/full-size/C12.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/C12/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/C12/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"none","d":"0%","c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":"Skilled mechanics - Navy people - merchants - clerks, $2,000","a":{"3":"N/A"}},"2":{"1":"75%","2":"25%","p":{"2":"firm"},"o":{"2":"fair"},"n":{"5":"0%"},"m":{"4":"0%"},"l":{"2":"25 to 40"},"k":{"2":"firm"},"j":{"2":"fair"},"i":{"5":"0%"},"h":{"1":"2000 to 3750"},"g":{"2":"2250 to 4500"},"f":{"2":"50%"},"d":{"1":"fair - good"},"c":{"2":"15 years"},"b":{"2":"frame"},"a":{"2":"1-family 2 story, 6-7 rooms"},"e":{"2":"97%"}},"3":{"1":"30","2":"bungalows, $3,250-4,000","3":"moderately"},"4":{"b":"20","a":"8 - $25,000"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"50","a":"22 - $65,200"},"6":"ample FHA","7":{"1":"9","2":"$25.00"},"8":"This area appeals to people of moderate income and the population is stable, with good pride of home ownership on many of the streets.

This downtown section surrounds the main retail sales district in Newport News. Generally speaking it is old and congested and suffers from proximity to the Newport News S.B. & D.D. Co. plant to the west, the encroachment of business and industry (including railroad tracks) and a large steel scrap yard to the east. About 10% of the structures are apartment hosues built during the World War and now renting for from $5.00 to $12.00 per room per month. The area bounded by 25th and 35th Streets from Washington to West Street is an older section of Newport News, still inhabited by substantial old families. The large frame and brick houses are closely built and would be difficult to sell, but this part of the area is better than the average. Elsewhere a number of old houses have been converted and are now used as boarding houses for which there is a good rental demand because of the close in location and convenience to employment at the shipyard and railroad terminal.

There is a hospital located in the southwest corner of the area. The houses are of various types, but are of uniformly standard construction, well set back from the street with lawns and shrubbery in good condition. The population is stable and evidences good pride of home ownership. The planning is good, and the houses well spaced on fifty-foot lots. Transportation is convenient by bus and street car and there are adequate neighborhood shopping facilities. Schools and churches are convenient. In general, age and obsolescence preclude the best classification for the neighborhood although it is still desirable.","9":{"1":"North End, Newport News","2":"2nd","3":"B-14","4":"Dec. 1939"}}},"D27":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-76.4251,36.9887],[-76.424,36.9868],[-76.4235,36.986],[-76.422,36.9836],[-76.4229,36.9832],[-76.4229,36.9832],[-76.4221,36.9817],[-76.4218,36.9812],[-76.4205,36.979],[-76.4188,36.976],[-76.4176,36.9765],[-76.4183,36.9778],[-76.4189,36.9791],[-76.4211,36.9822],[-76.4161,36.9842],[-76.416,36.9839],[-76.4156,36.9833],[-76.4153,36.9831],[-76.4127,36.9841],[-76.412,36.9831],[-76.4116,36.9825],[-76.4109,36.9814],[-76.4105,36.9808],[-76.4104,36.9807],[-76.4126,36.9799],[-76.4132,36.9797],[-76.4132,36.9797],[-76.4112,36.9766],[-76.4099,36.9746],[-76.4086,36.9725],[-76.4101,36.9715],[-76.4109,36.971],[-76.4128,36.9698],[-76.4156,36.9727],[-76.4169,36.9739],[-76.4193,36.973],[-76.4195,36.9729],[-76.4215,36.9764],[-76.4225,36.976],[-76.4236,36.9778],[-76.424,36.9786],[-76.425,36.9801],[-76.4257,36.9812],[-76.4265,36.9826],[-76.4269,36.9832],[-76.4275,36.9843],[-76.4282,36.9854],[-76.4282,36.9854],[-76.4266,36.9859],[-76.4269,36.9864],[-76.427,36.9866],[-76.4276,36.9864],[-76.429,36.9859],[-76.4302,36.9875],[-76.4274,36.9886],[-76.4256,36.9893],[-76.4251,36.9887]]]]},"labelCoords":[36.9758556640625,-76.4143943359375],"center":[36.979,-76.418],"boundingBox":[[36.97,-76.43],[36.989,-76.409]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.587,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/full-size/D27.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/D27/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/VA/Norfolk/1940/D27/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/VA/Norfolk/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"none","d":"95%","c":{"2":"N/A"},"b":"Domestics - Laborers - R.R. & shipyard workers, $500-1,500","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"75%","2":"25%","p":{"2":"static"},"o":{"2":"fair"},"n":{"5":"0%"},"m":{"4":"0%"},"l":{"2":"6"},"k":{"2":"weak"},"j":{"2":"poor"},"i":{"5":"0%"},"h":{"4":"0%"},"g":{"2":"450 to 1000"},"f":{"2":"10%"},"e":{"2":"95%"},"d":{"2":"very poor"},"c":{"2":"22 years"},"b":{"2":"frame"},"a":{"2":"4-family, 3-room units"}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"N/A","3":"N/A"},"4":{"b":"50","a":"5 - $21,900"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"50","a":"5 - $6,100"},"6":"Very limited","7":{"1":"9","2":"$30.50"},"8":"A level area approximately 75% built up, with congested, old houses in very poor condition, some of which are in rows.

Since the security area map was limited in size, only Rivermont and a section of Hilton are shown on the map. Hilton Village was developed during the World War by the U.S. Housing Corportation and was later sold in one trade to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company who subsequently marketed this group of about 200 small homes, to individual owners. This particular group of homes in Hilton Village would probably now fall in the $3,500-$4,500 class and while because of age they would not classify as first grade, they have been beneficially influenced by good maintenance, pride of ownership, and character of the surrounding developments. THe newer construction is sound, well-planned, and has attracted a good middle and upper middle class of people. Morrison is also an established community. Other developments mentioned are of more recent origin. The construction is sound, well planned and attractive. The terrain is slightly rolling in some places but generally level. Brick and frame houses are well spaced and some are on very large lots. There is no important concentration of new houses in one place but construction is preceding slowly throughout the area and it is attracting the executives and business men of Newport News.
