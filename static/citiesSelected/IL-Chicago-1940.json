A few two, three, and six flats were put up by speculators to stimulate development. However, this measure was no successful and the area lapsed into stagnation. Probably some future building will come for it offers the only location in Cicero with any real room for new housing and where some pattern has been established.

The neighborhood is rated third class because of its down trend and penalized still further because of adverse influences noted above.","9":{"1":"Evanston, Ill.","2":"3rd","3":"C-29","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"C99":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.7466,41.9314],[-87.7512,41.9314],[-87.7562,41.9313],[-87.7564,41.9386],[-87.7469,41.9388],[-87.7466,41.9314]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.7466,41.9314],[-87.7512,41.9314],[-87.7562,41.9313],[-87.7564,41.9386],[-87.7469,41.9388],[-87.7466,41.9314]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.935050000000004,-87.7515],"center":[41.935,-87.752],"boundingBox":[[41.931,-87.756],[41.939,-87.747]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.248,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C99.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C99/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C99/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Polish","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Polish"},"b":"Lower middle class","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"75%","2":"20%","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"$35.00-37.50- Good"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"15+"},"l":{"2":"$30.00-35.00"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"$8,000- fairly good"},"i":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"4":"12+"},"g":{"2":"$6,250-7,850"},"f":{"2":"65%"},"e":{"2":"98%"},"d":{"2":"Fairly good"},"c":{"2":"15 years"},"a":{"1":"Bungalows- 5 rooms"},"b":{"2":"Brick"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"December 31, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 19, 1900"},"6":"FHA 80%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a slowly declining area of predominantly five room bungalows of brick construction with a few frame units centered at the north near Belmont Avenue.

It is a typical Jewish section with the children playing all over the street, and properties generally showing lack of respect by tenants. It is significant to note that many of the buildings which are now owned by Jews are now being forced into the market very sharply, and other institutional owners have instituted a policy of cutting prices and considering any offer of a reasonable nature. Prices on all classes of one to four-family houses have broken during the past two years, and are still below 1935 level, although it is generally believed that prices on income-producing properties will remain fairly firm during the next six to twelve months. In spite of the fact that this section has excellent transportation, very good shopping facilities and is convenient to the beach, the fact that is is practically 80 per cent Jewish limits its appeal to other than this class of resident, and it is most doubtful that any reversal of the present down trend can be expected. About 65 per cent of the buildings are large apartments renting for $12 per room. The maintenance cost on multiple units are so high that buildings produce practically no return on investment.

Rents quoted above on two family structures are for heated units, and most of these buildings in this territory are so rented. About 5 per cent of the structures are large apartments renting for $10.00 to $11.00 a room.

Pride of ownership is very apparent and both streets have beautiful shade trees. The future of hte section is well assured because of the many advantages offered. There is a minimum flow of traffic along the streets, as they are both dead end at the western extremity. Transportation, schools and shopping centers are adequate and convenient for a neighborhood of this kind. The neighborhood is graded first grade because of the presence of so many favorable influences, but rated minus because of the age of some of the structures.","9":{"1":"Wilmette, Ill.","2":"Low 1st","3":"A-23","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"C118":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.7065,41.9249],[-87.7064,41.9219],[-87.7027,41.922],[-87.7025,41.92],[-87.708,41.92],[-87.7082,41.9246],[-87.7174,41.9246],[-87.7175,41.9319],[-87.6976,41.932],[-87.6977,41.9293],[-87.691,41.9292],[-87.691,41.9276],[-87.7066,41.9277],[-87.7065,41.9249]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.7065,41.9249],[-87.7064,41.9219],[-87.7027,41.922],[-87.7025,41.92],[-87.708,41.92],[-87.7082,41.9246],[-87.7174,41.9246],[-87.7175,41.9319],[-87.6976,41.932],[-87.6977,41.9293],[-87.691,41.9292],[-87.691,41.9276],[-87.7066,41.9277],[-87.7065,41.9249]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.928250000000006,-87.71374999999999],"center":[41.928,-87.707],"boundingBox":[[41.92,-87.718],[41.932,-87.691]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.509,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C118.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C118/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C118/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Better class replacing Jewish","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Mixture"},"b":"Middle and lower middle class","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"40%","2":"40%","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Good- $35.00"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"15+"},"l":{"2":"$26.00-35.00"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Fair"},"i":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"4":"11+"},"g":{"2":"$2,250-3,600"},"f":{"2":"85%"},"e":{"2":"99-100%"},"d":{"2":"Fair"},"c":{"2":"35-40 years"},"b":{"2":"Frame- brick"},"a":{"2":"1-family; 6 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"January 1, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 9, 1900"},"6":"B&L- 66 2/3 at 6%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This old neighborhood around Logan Square has suffered from obsolescence and because of appearance and age is rated \"C\".

The area is graded \"B\" because of the many adverse influences noted, but with their elimination and the provision of a local school it is conceivable that this district could improve to a first class area.","9":{"1":"Highland Park, Ill.","2":"2nd","3":"B-5","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"C4":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.8085,42.2032],[-87.8086,42.1956],[-87.8182,42.1959],[-87.8176,42.2108],[-87.8156,42.2108],[-87.8126,42.2069],[-87.8085,42.2068],[-87.8085,42.2032]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.8085,42.2032],[-87.8086,42.1956],[-87.8182,42.1959],[-87.8176,42.2108],[-87.8156,42.2108],[-87.8126,42.2069],[-87.8085,42.2068],[-87.8085,42.2032]]]]},"labelCoords":[42.20052578125001,-87.81327421875001],"center":[42.202,-87.814],"boundingBox":[[42.196,-87.818],[42.211,-87.808]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.423,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C4.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C4/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C4/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Italian"},"b":"Lower & lower middle class- laborers- local workers","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"75%","2":"25%","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":"Two family- converted"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Very limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a very mediocre residential community of small frame houses on small lots.

The layout of the streets is attractive, but it is doubtful that the section will ever improve beyond a second class area.","9":{"1":"Highland Park, Ill.","2":"2nd","3":"B-7","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"C7":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.7962,42.1815],[-87.7919,42.1748],[-87.7928,42.1748],[-87.7936,42.1749],[-87.7944,42.1745],[-87.7952,42.1738],[-87.7959,42.1735],[-87.7983,42.1766],[-87.7978,42.1768],[-87.798,42.1772],[-87.7987,42.1777],[-87.7988,42.1781],[-87.7991,42.179],[-87.7993,42.1796],[-87.7999,42.1799],[-87.8006,42.18],[-87.8037,42.1801],[-87.805,42.1798],[-87.805,42.1733],[-87.8074,42.1733],[-87.8074,42.1798],[-87.8076,42.18],[-87.8085,42.18],[-87.809,42.18],[-87.8093,42.1804],[-87.8096,42.1819],[-87.8082,42.1828],[-87.8085,42.1836],[-87.8084,42.1851],[-87.8084,42.1853],[-87.8077,42.1851],[-87.807,42.1852],[-87.8037,42.1851],[-87.8039,42.1862],[-87.8054,42.1862],[-87.8054,42.1871],[-87.8035,42.1871],[-87.8035,42.1883],[-87.801,42.1883],[-87.7962,42.1815]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.7962,42.1815],[-87.7919,42.1748],[-87.7928,42.1748],[-87.7936,42.1749],[-87.7944,42.1745],[-87.7952,42.1738],[-87.7959,42.1735],[-87.7983,42.1766],[-87.7978,42.1768],[-87.798,42.1772],[-87.7987,42.1777],[-87.7988,42.1781],[-87.7991,42.179],[-87.7993,42.1796],[-87.7999,42.1799],[-87.8006,42.18],[-87.8037,42.1801],[-87.805,42.1798],[-87.805,42.1733],[-87.8074,42.1733],[-87.8074,42.1798],[-87.8076,42.18],[-87.8085,42.18],[-87.809,42.18],[-87.8093,42.1804],[-87.8096,42.1819],[-87.8082,42.1828],[-87.8085,42.1836],[-87.8084,42.1851],[-87.8084,42.1853],[-87.8077,42.1851],[-87.807,42.1852],[-87.8037,42.1851],[-87.8039,42.1862],[-87.8054,42.1862],[-87.8054,42.1871],[-87.8035,42.1871],[-87.8035,42.1883],[-87.801,42.1883],[-87.7962,42.1815]]]]},"labelCoords":[42.18320234375,-87.80122109375],"center":[42.181,-87.802],"boundingBox":[[42.173,-87.81],[42.188,-87.792]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.418,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C7.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C7/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C7/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"2":""},"b":"Middle class","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"95%","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 1, 1900","2":"One family","3":"Owner built"},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 1, 1900"},"6":"60%","7":{"1":"April 21, 1905","2":"$6.58 average"},"8":"This is a well located neighborhood of older houses slowly declining in desirability, although in good rental demand because of convenience to schools, transportation, and shopping centers.

The area is graded first class because of its uniformity and favorable reputation, but given a minus rating becaues some of the improvements are slightly older.","9":{"1":"Highland Park, Ill.","2":"Low 1st","3":"A-5","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"B9":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.7718,42.1556],[-87.7707,42.1555],[-87.7699,42.1555],[-87.7698,42.1525],[-87.7718,42.1523],[-87.7749,42.1559],[-87.7748,42.1572],[-87.774,42.1563],[-87.7729,42.1559],[-87.7718,42.1556]]],[[[-87.779,42.1683],[-87.7782,42.1678],[-87.7774,42.1678],[-87.7767,42.1678],[-87.7767,42.1655],[-87.7764,42.1632],[-87.779,42.1634],[-87.7771,42.1598],[-87.779,42.1597],[-87.7919,42.1748],[-87.7962,42.1815],[-87.7933,42.1812],[-87.7903,42.1766],[-87.7866,42.1733],[-87.779,42.1683]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.7718,42.1556],[-87.7707,42.1555],[-87.7699,42.1555],[-87.7698,42.1525],[-87.7718,42.1523],[-87.7749,42.1559],[-87.7748,42.1572],[-87.774,42.1563],[-87.7729,42.1559],[-87.7718,42.1556]],[[-87.779,42.1683],[-87.7782,42.1678],[-87.7774,42.1678],[-87.7767,42.1678],[-87.7767,42.1655],[-87.7764,42.1632],[-87.779,42.1634],[-87.7771,42.1598],[-87.779,42.1597],[-87.7919,42.1748],[-87.7962,42.1815],[-87.7933,42.1812],[-87.7903,42.1766],[-87.7866,42.1733],[-87.779,42.1683]]]]},"labelCoords":[42.15402265625,-87.77133984375],"center":[42.168,-87.783],"boundingBox":[[42.152,-87.796],[42.181,-87.77]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.392,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/B9.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B9/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B9/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"2":""},"b":"Middle & upper middle class","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"100%","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 5, 1900","2":"One family","3":"Owner built"},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Ample FHA","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This section is about 80 per cent built up.

Foreclosures in this districtt were fairly heavy, but they have been mostly resold. A number of families formerly living in this district have moved to newer areas in Winnetka, and there are a number of properties for sale by individual owners, but they are generally considered to be priced well above present market value. They are therefore not selling. The district has a good community spirit and is further favorably affected by its nearness to New Trier Township High Schoool at the southern end of the district. Warwick nad Abbotsford classes are in the Kenilworth school district, which is particularly favorable because classes are generally very small. Transportation and shopping centers are convenient and the proximity to Lake Michigan is a further advantage to the district. Improvements on Hawthorne are older and somewhat poorer than the balance of the territory.

Schools are also very good and transportation available by commuter tarin, North Shore Electric, as well as elevated which ends at Third and Linden. Properties along Sheridan Road are somewhat better than those on the other streets, but they are less desirable because of the heavy traffic flow along Sheridan Road, particularly on Sunday. Properties in east Wilmette carry a certain social advantage and this reputation is traded upon whenever properties are sold. Pride of ownership is very apparent, most properties being well shrubbed. The streets are lined with beautiful, large, shade trees. Vacancy is virtually nill, and becausae of this heavy occupancy there is some indication that an upward adjustment in rents may be affected during 1940. The price bracket above includes the majority of the structures, but there are a number of estate properties valued well above $20,000. Mortgage financing is limited to $16,000 as a matter of policy by most major lenders. This is not meant to indicate that (over) financing is not available in the district. Properties along the south side of Lake Ave. west of Sheridan Road are very good. Altho it might be said that many of the structures in this territoty are somewhat obsolete, considerable reconditioning and remodeling is continually taking place, and the section is certainly considered to be \"holding its own\", at the present time. The northern tip of this area is somewhat adversely affected by the proximity to a section called \"No Man's Land\", which has recently been annexed to the village of Wilmette. The legallity of this annexatino is now being contested in the courts, but irrespective of the outcome, the adverse influence will probably continue altho is will be necessarily minimized should the village gain control, as they will probably eliminate all small business and possibly close the beach to other than local residents. The new construction has been a recent subdivision of a piece of vacant ground lying along the railroad at the end of the extension of Ashland and Greenwood Aves. This was a speculative development, and more favorably located should warrant a \"A\" classification, but because of its proximity to the railroad it is rated as \"B\".

It is somewhat better than the average negro district in that the bulk of the houses are one family detached units in anything but a congested district for this class of population. Here live the servants for many of the families all along the north shore. There is not a vacant house in the territory, and occupancy, moreover, is about 150 per cent, for most houses have more than one family living in them. Sales have been very good where liberal financing terms are available, but on other sales mortgage financing is virtually impossible to obtain. This concentration of negroes in Evanston is quite a serious problem for the town as they seem to be growing steadily and encroaching into adjoining neighborhoods.

Home ownership is about average but it is significant to note that there are a number of homes in the territory listed for sale.

About 10 per cent of the structures are three-family units valued up to $11,500, renting $45-60.","9":{"1":"Rogers Park","2":"3rd","3":"C-67","4":"Oct. 1939"}}},"B43":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6781,42.0472],[-87.6767,42.0509],[-87.6742,42.0504],[-87.6741,42.0467],[-87.6737,42.0462],[-87.6723,42.0429],[-87.6711,42.0427],[-87.6702,42.0412],[-87.67,42.0407],[-87.67,42.0398],[-87.67,42.0395],[-87.6693,42.0392],[-87.669,42.0388],[-87.6694,42.0375],[-87.6699,42.0363],[-87.6696,42.0354],[-87.6695,42.0347],[-87.6695,42.0335],[-87.6696,42.0322],[-87.6693,42.0317],[-87.6692,42.0306],[-87.6687,42.03],[-87.6684,42.0294],[-87.6683,42.0286],[-87.6684,42.0282],[-87.6675,42.027],[-87.6674,42.0265],[-87.6695,42.0265],[-87.6698,42.0296],[-87.6712,42.0296],[-87.6714,42.0342],[-87.674,42.0342],[-87.6743,42.0366],[-87.6759,42.0366],[-87.6759,42.0402],[-87.6767,42.0402],[-87.6765,42.0439],[-87.6772,42.0444],[-87.6768,42.0456],[-87.6774,42.0459],[-87.677,42.0465],[-87.6784,42.0469],[-87.6781,42.0472]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6781,42.0472],[-87.6767,42.0509],[-87.6742,42.0504],[-87.6741,42.0467],[-87.6737,42.0462],[-87.6723,42.0429],[-87.6711,42.0427],[-87.6702,42.0412],[-87.67,42.0407],[-87.67,42.0398],[-87.67,42.0395],[-87.6693,42.0392],[-87.669,42.0388],[-87.6694,42.0375],[-87.6699,42.0363],[-87.6696,42.0354],[-87.6695,42.0347],[-87.6695,42.0335],[-87.6696,42.0322],[-87.6693,42.0317],[-87.6692,42.0306],[-87.6687,42.03],[-87.6684,42.0294],[-87.6683,42.0286],[-87.6684,42.0282],[-87.6675,42.027],[-87.6674,42.0265],[-87.6695,42.0265],[-87.6698,42.0296],[-87.6712,42.0296],[-87.6714,42.0342],[-87.674,42.0342],[-87.6743,42.0366],[-87.6759,42.0366],[-87.6759,42.0402],[-87.6767,42.0402],[-87.6765,42.0439],[-87.6772,42.0444],[-87.6768,42.0456],[-87.6774,42.0459],[-87.677,42.0465],[-87.6784,42.0469],[-87.6781,42.0472]]]]},"labelCoords":[42.039261718749984,-87.67294296875],"center":[42.04,-87.673],"boundingBox":[[42.027,-87.678],[42.051,-87.667]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.327,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/B43.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B43/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B43/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"2":""},"b":"Upper class","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"95%","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 1, 1900","2":"One family","3":"owner built"},"4":{"b":"Nominal","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Ample up to $15,000 @ 4-4 1/2%","7":{"1":"April 21, 1905","2":"$6.50"},"8":"This is an area of fine old large houses in a very beautiful location, with large trees on well kept properties. Proximity to Lake Michigan is favorable, but there are practically no riparian properties except between Kedzie and Keeney, and between Lee and Main on Edgemere Road. These two short blocks because of their riparian rights warrant a first class rating, but are included in this area because of their small size. Houses on Edgemere are particularly outstanding and their age is only about 12 years. The lake front, except as noted above, is all park district with many bathing beaches along its entire length. Each year a separate bathing beach is designated for the large colored population living in Evanston, the thought being a constant shifting of this locatino would minimize the adverse affect of negro bathing facilities. Living in the area are some of Evanston's fine, old wealth families, and in spite of the age of the structures, the neighborhood continues as one of the most desirable along the shore. Schools and churches are particularly good and transportation is available by either elevated or commuter train. Main Street (over) and Davis St. are the main shopping centers. Rentals on these larger houses have remained unchanged in recent years but vacancy has decreased. In a few cases some of the large houses have nothing more than caretaker occupancy at nominal rents. The neighborhood is graded \"B\" because of the age of the buildings, but could almost warrant a more favorable rating from the standpoint of class of occupancy and Lake Michigan location. The new construction is located on Forest Ave. at Burnham Place. This site is a former estate which has been broken up for subdividing purposes. The houses were built to individual specifications. Further development of this character may be anticipated, but it is rather doubtful that it will be of very large proportions.

The bulk of the one family structures are of substantial age, and altho fairly readily sold, other second class areas in Evanston and along the north shore are in greater demand. This neighborhood is very well located and is particuarly convenient to both elevated and commuter train transportation, the latter stopping at Main St. there are about six houses on Dempster, between Judson and Forest Aves., which are and have been for a number of years, occupied by negroes. Their location in this vicinity adversely affects the adjoining properties, but it is very doubtful that they will ever spread any further than they already are. The bulk of the property in this section is very well held, and has many occupants of long standing in their present structures. Apartment buildings are concentrated on Hinman, south of Lee St. and on Michigan, Sheridan, and Sheridan Square, south of Keeney. These structures came into the area prior to 1929 and are generally speaking, first class apartments renting for an average of $20.00 per room. The residential structures on these (over) three streets are older than the bulk of the properties in the area as a whole, and should be graded no better than third class, primarily because they are noticeably obsolete. Their value is only slightly above the value of the ground, and it is generally believed that when apartment house construction again gets under way, many of these units will be razed and the ground improved with apartments similar to those already here. Rents quotes above on two and three family structures are for heated units. The higher priced two and three structures are for heated units. The higher priced two and three family structures are in most cases deluxe buildings. One family units in the balance of the territory range from good to mediocre, but because of the favorable reputation of East Evanston, the neighborhood is graded as second grade, but rated as minus becaues its future seems somewhat unassured. There is a good shopping center on Main St. and a first class shopping center around the intersection of Sherman and Davis. There is little possibility of this neighborhood being adversely affected in the near future, by an infiltration of a class other than that which occupies the neighborhood today. Hinman is the least desirable street because of heavy traffic, and because west side backs up to business on Chicago Ave. Asssessed values are high.","9":{"1":"Evanston, Ill.","2":"Low 2nd","3":"B-42","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"C20":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.7161,42.041],[-87.7134,42.041],[-87.7135,42.0354],[-87.7162,42.0355],[-87.7161,42.041]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.7161,42.041],[-87.7134,42.041],[-87.7135,42.0354],[-87.7162,42.0355],[-87.7161,42.041]]]]},"labelCoords":[42.0382,-87.7148],"center":[42.038,-87.715],"boundingBox":[[42.035,-87.716],[42.041,-87.713]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.054,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C20.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C20/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C20/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"2":""},"b":"Middle class","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"90%","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This area is a small concentration of two family buildings isolated from shopping centers and transportation and distant to schools.

The more expensive rentals quoted above for three-family units are semi-deluxe buildings where apartments have two baths. The more favorable increase in prices indicated on three-family units between 1935 and 1936 is occasioned by the seriously depressed values on this class of property during most of the depression. There is a possibility that the Edgewater Golf Club may eventually be sub-divided and at present it is assessed for $10,000 per acre which would mean that any development would be equally high grade.

The three-family units, however, are largely concentrated primarily west of California and constitute about 25 per cent of the structures, valued $12,000-14,000 and renting for $60 to $75. These units show a slight weakness in price structure because of the inclination of institutional holders to force these properties into the market. The somewhat unfavorable experience in prices on one-family houses is occasioned by the competition of new construction occurring in this area, and in the area immediately to the north and northwest. Although only a minimum of new construction is occurring in this section, it is of a lower grade than that that is already here. It is anticipated that further construction will continue but it will be in a price range between $7,000 and $8,500. The prices quoted above on all classes of units (over) are expected to remain relatively firm during the next six to twelve months. The general reputation of the section is good. Shopping centers and schools west of California are somewhat inconvenient but improvements throughout the area are comparatively uniform. There is a sizeable number of deluxe three-family units valued in today's market between $15,000 and $19,000 renting between $80.00 and $95.00 per unit. Larger apartments constitute about 20 per cent of the buildings and rent for $10.00 to $12.00 per room. Prices on two-family units have remained relatively stable primarily because these buildings are so well held. Although there are a few Jewish families in this neighborhood, no marked infiltration is noticeable at the present time, and the section should remain fairly stable during the next three to five years.","9":{"1":"Rogers Park","2":"2nd","3":"B-73","4":"Oct. 1939"}}},"B77":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.709,41.9974],[-87.6897,41.9977],[-87.6897,41.994],[-87.7098,41.994],[-87.7099,41.9971],[-87.709,41.9974]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.709,41.9974],[-87.6897,41.9977],[-87.6897,41.994],[-87.7098,41.994],[-87.7099,41.9971],[-87.709,41.9974]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.995850000000004,-87.69324999999996],"center":[41.996,-87.7],"boundingBox":[[41.994,-87.71],[41.998,-87.69]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.255,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/B77.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B77/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B77/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Jewish from Albany Park","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Jewish"},"b":"","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"35%","2":"25%","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Good- up to $50.00"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"11+"},"l":{"2":"$40.00-50.00"},"k":{"2":"Slightly weak"},"j":{"2":"Fair- up to $7,500"},"i":{"5":"9-"},"h":{"4":"13+"},"g":{"2":"$5,500-9,500"},"f":{"2":"60%"},"e":{"2":"99-100%"},"d":{"2":"Good"},"c":{"2":"17-18 years"},"b":{"2":"Brick- stucco"},"a":{"2":"One-family; 5-6 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"December 30, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 5, 1900"},"6":"FHA 80%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This are is similar in many respects to the section directly north of Devon, but a marked infiltration of Jewish has adversely affected values since 19937.

Because of the market infiltration, a slight weakness in the price structure and the anticipated down trend, it is recommended that an orderly but quick liquidation be followed in this neighborhood. Area is graded \"B\" because of improvements and appearance, but penalized because of changing occupancy. About 20 per cent of the structures are two-family units valued from $8,500 to $11,000; renting $50-65; prices on these properties are also somewhat weak.","9":{"1":"Rogers Park","2":"Low 2nd","3":"B-77","4":"Oct. 1939"}}},"B63":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6895,41.9903],[-87.6891,41.9796],[-87.6891,41.9795],[-87.6926,41.9796],[-87.6926,41.9796],[-87.6929,41.9817],[-87.6951,41.9831],[-87.6987,41.9831],[-87.699,41.9856],[-87.7096,41.9921],[-87.7097,41.9929],[-87.7098,41.994],[-87.6897,41.994],[-87.6895,41.9903]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6895,41.9903],[-87.6891,41.9796],[-87.6891,41.9795],[-87.6926,41.9796],[-87.6926,41.9796],[-87.6929,41.9817],[-87.6951,41.9831],[-87.6987,41.9831],[-87.699,41.9856],[-87.7096,41.9921],[-87.7097,41.9929],[-87.7098,41.994],[-87.6897,41.994],[-87.6895,41.9903]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.98867578125,-87.69473359374999],"center":[41.989,-87.697],"boundingBox":[[41.98,-87.71],[41.994,-87.689]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.611,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/B63.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B63/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B63/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Jewish, north of Peterson","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"2":"Scandinavian-German"},"b":"Middle class","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Good- up to $50.00"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"12+"},"l":{"2":"$35.00-55.00"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Fairly good- up to $7,500"},"i":{"5":"6-"},"f":{"2":"December 30, 1899"},"e":{"2":"December 30, 1899"},"d":{"2":"Good"},"c":{"2":"12-15 years"},"b":{"2":"Brick- few stone"},"a":{"2":"One-family; 6-7 rooms"},"h":{"4":"12+"},"g":{"2":"$5,750-9,000"}},"3":{"1":"January 3, 1900","2":"One-family","3":"Owner built"},"4":{"b":"50 units","a":"January 9, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"January 19, 1900","a":"January 9, 1900"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This neighborhood of two-family houses is inconvenient to good transportation, but properties are of good character and well maintained.

Shopping center is about 1 1/2 miles; churches and schools convenient. There was some building in this area all thru the depression. A few properties, 6-8 years old can be sold at $15,000. Generally, nothing below this figure. Rosary College, a high grade Catholic school for girls, is located at the west end. Dominican Seminary and also a Lutheran College at the east end. There is a Catholic Church at Lathrop and North Ave. Grammar school and Catholic high school in area. Ashland Ave. is restricteed to dwellings costing $40,000 on 100' lots. However, this restriction is, at present, being fought by an influential property owner and probably will be defeated. Land values are about $80. a front foot.

One negro family resides in the area, but there is no possibility whatever of any further infiltration. Catholic influence is strongly felt due to a fine, large church and parcochial school; and the majority of property owners between Oak Park and Ridgeland Aves. are Catholic and what demand there is due to (over) proximity of religious and educational facilities.

Rentals quoted above on 2 and 3-family structures are for heated units, but there are also a number of buildings such as these in which units are rented on an unheated basis, and they average from $30.00 to $35.00. A number of corners also have larger apartment buildings. Approach to the area is through blighted territory, which is unfavorable, and, altho the section is fair, trend of desirability is downward in spite of the fact that rents are far above average for rental units in adjoining areas. Most properties are set back slightly from the sidewalk, but lots are quite uniformly 25 foot. The neighborhood is graded third class because of age and slightly downward trend, and also penalized because of unfavorable approach and proximity of blighted areas.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"3rd","3":"C-156","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"C142":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.7941,41.8723],[-87.7747,41.8726],[-87.7746,41.8708],[-87.7744,41.8655],[-87.779,41.8654],[-87.8028,41.8648],[-87.8041,41.8648],[-87.8044,41.8726],[-87.8044,41.8731],[-87.7941,41.8723]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.7941,41.8723],[-87.7747,41.8726],[-87.7746,41.8708],[-87.7744,41.8655],[-87.779,41.8654],[-87.8028,41.8648],[-87.8041,41.8648],[-87.8044,41.8726],[-87.8044,41.8731],[-87.7941,41.8723]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.8688203125,-87.8001203125],"center":[41.869,-87.79],"boundingBox":[[41.865,-87.804],[41.873,-87.774]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.782,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C142.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C142/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C142/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Few Italian","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Italian"},"b":"Clerks- \"white-collar\"- skilled laborers-mechanics","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"Few","a":"January 3, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 13, 1900"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"The southernmost and probably least desirable area of Oak Park.

The eastern part of the section is already blighted and the blight is extending westward, although it has not yet overtaken the northwest corner west of Damen and north nof Division; this latter portion is the best part of this district. In addition to the prices quoted above, about 5 per cent of the structures are 4-family units, selling between $3,000 and $4,000. Most lots are 25 feet or less, with houses built very close together, most of them immediately adjacent to the sidewalk. Population is largely lower class Polish, but there is a marked infiltration of Italian from the district to the south, and the future of the area appears even less secure than it is today. The new subway, which is under construction at the present time, will run out Milwaukee Ave. and reduce (over) the transportation time to the loop to approximately five minutes, whereas, it is now about twenty. This may have a favorable effect on property values, but it is most doubtful that it will ever be of sufficient importance to favorably affect trend of desirability in the neighborhood or attract a better class population. Milwaukee Ave. is a commercial street throughout its entire length, and, as such, is considered a fair business section. The best local shopping center is on Chicago Avenue, between Ashland and Damen. Because of its mixed character and the disrepair of most properties, the district is most unattractive to other than lower-income groups and it is, therefore, graded fourth class, with the further comment that it will be even poorer during the coming years. It is somewhat questionable whether this would be an advisable place for a slum clearance project.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"4th","3":"D-29","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"D32":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6871,41.8937],[-87.6573,41.8943],[-87.6617,41.8895],[-87.6868,41.889],[-87.6871,41.8937]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6871,41.8937],[-87.6573,41.8943],[-87.6617,41.8895],[-87.6868,41.889],[-87.6871,41.8937]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.891815625,-87.66374687499997],"center":[41.892,-87.673],"boundingBox":[[41.889,-87.687],[41.894,-87.657]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.461,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/D32.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D32/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D32/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Negro","d":"5%","c":{"2":"Italian- 20% mixed"},"b":"Lower class- laborers- \"reliefers\"","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"50%","2":"25%","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Fair"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"December 30, 1899"},"l":{"2":"$7.50-15.00"},"k":{"2":"Weak"},"j":{"2":"Poor"},"i":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"4":"December 30, 1899"},"g":{"2":"$1,000-2,000"},"f":{"2":"Low"},"e":{"2":"99%"},"d":{"2":"Poor"},"c":{"2":"60 years"},"b":{"2":"Frame- brick"},"a":{"2":"One family 4-5 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 3, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is one of the poorest areas around the Chicago Loop.

The quality of housing improves westward and there is a scattering of brick, two family structures near the west end. Nearly all of the small, cheap cottages are occupied by owners and the rental range does not include this type of housing.

Land values are quite high due to the fact that the area is zoned for apartment buildings. This penalizes single family occupancy because of high taxes based on exclusive land values, which are from $60-80 a front foot, altho one authority estimates them at $100 a front foot. An example of this is shown where HOLC had a house on Mason St. exposed for sale over a (over) period of two years at prices beginning at $6,000 and going down to $4,500. it was finally sold for $3,800. The land alone is taxed based on a valuation exceeding that amount. This area is favored by good transportation and by proximity to a good Catholic Church and parochial school. There are a few scattered two flats in which units rent for about $55. Columbus Park on the south affords exceptional recreational advantages.

Rosary College adjacent at the west 1/2 of the area at the north boundary. Lutheran College is situated in the north part of the eastern half of the area. Transportatino and shopping facilities not very convenient (about 6-8 blocks). There are some large homes in this area costing as much as $50,000 and above. Maintenance is good throughout. Good architecture, good planting, and large lots with good setbacks make for charm. Values slightly high north of Thomas and away from east, south,a nd west boundaries. On east side of Harlem Ave is an area considerably less (over) desirable. The western half is more built up with brick homes. In the west are a good number of frame structures, some 20 years old. There is a 128 units apartment building now under construction on Harlem & Chicago Aves. to cost $475,000. It is FHA financed, ready for occupancy May let.

The Indian Harbor Belt Line Railroad terminates here and has yards and shops just south of the residential development. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R.R. also passes from east to west though the town, and the Soo Line R.R. cuts the village at the eastern portion. Franklin Ave. running southeast and northwest, is the principal thorofare, along which are some small stores and taverns. The village has a good high school at the north end and there are grammar schools availabel as well. Shopping facilities are only mediocre, and many residents avail themselves of the excellent shopping centers in Oak Park about 3 miles south. Shortly after the development of Franklin Park many lots were sold to outsiders seeking speculative possibilities. Following hte panic of 1894, the developers took back a large number of these lots and (over) sicne then taxes have piled up, as well as general and special assessments, so that development has been retarded as a result. There is a small steel wire mill at the edge of the residential district at King and Eddington St. This company probably employs around 75 wage earners. There is a small industrial section lying just south of Grand Ave. along the Soo Line tracks. This, however, has only a sligth affect upon the residential area.

Melrose Park is populated principally by persons of German descent, altho it has been known as an Italian community. Some improvement has been seen here due to a change of local administration and the induction of a new Chief of Police. Despite this improvement, the town has a bad name with lending agencies, and it is quite difficult to secure mortgage loans without FHA provision. About the only company willing to lend here on funds is the Bell Savings Building $ Loans Assn. One developer built about 60 brick bungalows in Melrose Park, which did not sell rapidly enoguh to suit him, whereupon he had his workmen sign contracts for the property and obtained loans from the North American Life Ins. Co., which institution soon became the owner through foreclosure of the bungalows, and is, at present, the principal institutional owner of foreclosed property within this area.

The area itself is about 30% built up with old, frame cottages and houses in poor conditiona and badly in need of paint. There is a grammer school convenient, but the nearest high school is in Maywoood, 3 miles distant. Transportation by Elevated direct to Chicago loop requires about 45 minutes. Shopping facilities are generally poor. Mortgage loans are nearly impossible, unless insured through FHA. Some blocks of builting lots have recently been acquired nearby, and it is not unlikely that development may be attempted. however despite these prospects, as it now stand in appearance, population, and demand, the area is no better than fourth grade.","9":{"1":"Bellwood, Ill.","2":"4th","3":"D-20","4":"Feb. 1940"}}},"C125":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.8741,41.8801],[-87.8774,41.8803],[-87.8773,41.8811],[-87.8831,41.881],[-87.883,41.8819],[-87.8825,41.8824],[-87.8815,41.8827],[-87.8744,41.8847],[-87.8741,41.8801]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.8741,41.8801],[-87.8774,41.8803],[-87.8773,41.8811],[-87.8831,41.881],[-87.883,41.8819],[-87.8825,41.8824],[-87.8815,41.8827],[-87.8744,41.8847],[-87.8741,41.8801]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.8823640625,-87.8760203125],"center":[41.882,-87.878],"boundingBox":[[41.88,-87.883],[41.885,-87.874]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.085,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C125.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C125/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C125/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Italian-Polish-Lithuanian"},"b":"Mixed- \"white collar\" artisans- mechanics","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a flat and somewhat older portion of the village built up along the Elevated Railway, and comprised of old, frame houses interspersed with a few brick bungalows not quite so old.

No Italians. 2's and 3's represent approximately 75 per cent of the buildings; 2's being more popular. Railroad tracks and industry are along the entire northern boundary and much industry also is located at the southeast; the National Lead Company is located at Peoria and 18th. $3,500 is approximately the top limit for any kind of property; anyone able to pay more goes west. The future of the of the entire blighted area is discouraging; population is decreasing; there is no immigration of foreigners. The younger element, through the use of our educational facilities, obtain a good education and ultimately obtain positions outside to the area. They talk the English language and, as they grow into manhood and womanhood and marry, have no desire to live here, preferring to either rent or buy in the better white sections of the city. The older people, who still talk their native language, do not wish to leve; although, in some case, the younger people have induced them to sell and go along with them. This has not been proven to be (over) satisfactory. The result is that only negro, Mexican, or the low-class white will move in; and these have no money. The future of this area is hopeless, unless by cooperation of the city and county authorities with property owners, some housing projects may be originated and completed, and part of the area rehabilitated through necessary demolishments. These foreigners, having raised their families, now find themselves in the positino of being unable to sell, even if they desired to. Almost every foreign nationality is represented in this section. Throughout the entire area, considerable vandalism occurs. On 19th Street, east from Western, is a mixture of many kinds of buildings; brick and stone, all in poor condition; although, it is noted that the Poles and Bohemians heep their properties up better than the Italians do in their area. Many homes and flats are built below the street level. There are a few party walls in this area. An old quarry, located between 18th and 19th, Lincoln and Wood, is used as a garbage dumping ground and, in summer, the odors from this are extremely offensive. 19th Street, east of Blue Island, becomes somewhat better, with many brick singles, 2s and 3's. A number of tenements exist. Halsted, a business street, north from 22nd, is exceedingly poor, mixed, with all kinds of frames and brick buildings. 18th Place and 22 have a number of 2-flats, cottages, frame and brick. Throughout the area are a number of stores with flats above. On Leavitt Street are many mixed old frame and brick buildings, with some party walls; and on Hoyne, cottages and 2's of frame and brick. No mortgage money available.

In some cases there are two buildings on the same lot, one of course being an alley property. Negro population is largely concentrated south of Division St., and west of Wells St., but a continued infiltration of this race has caused an overflow north of that point; and it is reasonable to assume that the section may eventually become more negro than Italian, which is the other predominating population class residing in this section today. (over) The area is highly congested; streets are dirty and alleys are strewn with refuse. There is a very heavy traffic flow both north and south, and east and west. Industrial encroachment from the south and west will probably gradually decrease the size of this section from a residential standpoint. A Government housing project is planned for the two blocks west of Sedgwick, running from Chicago to Division. A private housing projected erected by the Marshall Field Estate, which occupies the ground between Evergreen St. and Blackhawk St., one block west of Sedgwick, has been comparatively successful, although rents in these buildings are not competitive with surrounding properties. Trend of desirability, from a residential point of view, continues steadily downward; but, because of the favorable location of the district from the point of accessibility to employment centers, this should be a logical place for further slum clearance projects. The area is much more mixed than the classification above would indicate, for there is no indication of uniformity of structures or design, and most units are in a sad state of disrepair. In the southwest corner many houses have been converted to multi-family use, even utilizing attics and basements for living quarters.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"4th","3":"D-30","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"D31":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6335,41.8965],[-87.6339,41.911],[-87.6315,41.911],[-87.6314,41.9077],[-87.6297,41.9077],[-87.6295,41.9041],[-87.6283,41.9041],[-87.6264,41.9005],[-87.6254,41.9006],[-87.6248,41.8917],[-87.6318,41.8917],[-87.6318,41.8966],[-87.6335,41.8965]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6335,41.8965],[-87.6339,41.911],[-87.6315,41.911],[-87.6314,41.9077],[-87.6297,41.9077],[-87.6295,41.9041],[-87.6283,41.9041],[-87.6264,41.9005],[-87.6254,41.9006],[-87.6248,41.8917],[-87.6318,41.8917],[-87.6318,41.8966],[-87.6335,41.8965]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.899698046875,-87.630025390625],"center":[41.9,-87.63],"boundingBox":[[41.892,-87.634],[41.911,-87.625]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.398,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/D31.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D31/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D31/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Transient population","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Mixed"},"b":"Lower class- lower middle class","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 5, 1900"},"6":"Very limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a very convenient location, immediately adjacent to the Chicago loop on the near north side.

There has also been considerable conversion of large homes and apartment house units into 2 and 3-room kitchenette apartments. Most properties are built immediately adjoining, with a maximum setback of about 15 feet. State and Dearborn both carry very heavy traffic and, because of the high use of the land, the appearance of the neighborhood is somewhat congested. Chicago's famous Ambassador Hotel is located on the northwest corner of State and Goethe. It is somewhat unfair to this district to say that it is declining in general desirability; but, because of its age and obsolescence (the latter being minimized by reconditioning and remodeling) the area is, nevertheless, graded third class because of its general appearance. Due consideratino must be given to the location, because of its convenience to Lake Michigan beaches and downtown Chicago. (over) Generally speaking, it is comparatively homogeneous and continues to attract fairly good class people and it is doubtful that any infiltration of noticeably less desirable tenants will soon occur.

There are several cooperative apartment buildings at the south end of Astor. Rentals on apartment units of 6 rooms and more are slightly weak at the present time; but, on smaller units, they are very strong. The trend of reducing these bigger units to smaller kitchenette apartments (over) may be expected to continue. In spite of its age, the area continues to attract very high-class people and, in many respects, the district is equally desirable as Lake Shore Drive, because of its seclusion from the heavy traffic.

Section is rated second class because of location, continued desirability and age of structure.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"2nd","3":"B-96","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"D51":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6318,41.8324],[-87.633,41.8324],[-87.6332,41.8347],[-87.635,41.8347],[-87.6354,41.8344],[-87.6356,41.8323],[-87.6368,41.8324],[-87.6365,41.8347],[-87.6392,41.8347],[-87.6393,41.8345],[-87.6392,41.8321],[-87.6462,41.8322],[-87.6462,41.8379],[-87.6464,41.8443],[-87.6466,41.8475],[-87.6438,41.8478],[-87.6428,41.8481],[-87.6422,41.8483],[-87.6409,41.8491],[-87.6393,41.8508],[-87.6369,41.8517],[-87.6352,41.8525],[-87.6347,41.8525],[-87.6317,41.8527],[-87.6318,41.8324]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6318,41.8324],[-87.633,41.8324],[-87.6332,41.8347],[-87.635,41.8347],[-87.6354,41.8344],[-87.6356,41.8323],[-87.6368,41.8324],[-87.6365,41.8347],[-87.6392,41.8347],[-87.6393,41.8345],[-87.6392,41.8321],[-87.6462,41.8322],[-87.6462,41.8379],[-87.6464,41.8443],[-87.6466,41.8475],[-87.6438,41.8478],[-87.6428,41.8481],[-87.6422,41.8483],[-87.6409,41.8491],[-87.6393,41.8508],[-87.6369,41.8517],[-87.6352,41.8525],[-87.6347,41.8525],[-87.6317,41.8527],[-87.6318,41.8324]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.84193632812501,-87.638975390625],"center":[41.842,-87.639],"boundingBox":[[41.832,-87.647],[41.853,-87.632]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.895,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/D51.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D51/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D51/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Yes- of all kinds","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Italian predominate"},"b":"Laborer, low wage earner- mixed","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"50%","2":"50%","p":{"2":"Static"},"o":{"2":"Fair"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"10+"},"l":{"2":"$9.00-13.50"},"k":{"2":"Static- down"},"j":{"2":"Fair up to $3,000"},"i":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"4":"10+"},"g":{"2":"$1,500-3,150"},"f":{"1":"60%"},"e":{"2":"90%"},"d":{"2":"Poor"},"c":{"2":"75 years"},"b":{"2":"Frame"},"a":{"2":"Two-flats"}},"3":{"1":"(some remodeling) 0","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 6, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Located between 22nd and 35th, Wentworth to Halsted; occupied almost entirely by foreigners, Italian predominating.

St. Mary's Girls High School is at Grenshaw and Hoyne. At Flournoy and Laflin is the McLaren School. On Ashland Boulevard, homes are of somewhat better appearance, mostly stone, some brick; all converted into union homes. On Marshfield are many 2's and 3's, stone; and north of Taylor, many party walls near Flournoy. The Chicago Mail Order Company is at Harrison and Marshfield; and the Cook County Hospital at Wolcott, Wood, Harrison and Polk. Polk Street, east of Western for several blocks, is poor, with old, small frame dwellings. On both sides of Claremont, north of Polk, are many brick party walls. On Oakley, between Harrison and Roosevelt, are 2's, brick and stone, and a few more substantial type of residences. Campbell Boulevard, between Oakley and Leavitt, is comprised of 2's, brick and stone, of good appearance. The city maintains (over) this boulevard; a driveway exists on each side of it. On Leavitt, south of Harrison to Roosevelt, are many party walls, stone and brick. A Nurses' Home, a large, pretentious building, is at Polk and Lincoln; and at Wolcott and Polk is the State Medical School of Illinois University. There is much vandaliism throughout the area; the future appears hopeless. Rush Medical College is at Harrison and Wood; and a proposition, still alive, exists to turn that portion of the area between Leavitt and Paulina, West Congress to West Roosevelt, into a huge medical center. This would materially assist the surrounding properties, as it would mean the establishment of parks, apartment buildings, and business houses, etc. A few hospitals already in the area are the Cook County Hospital, University Hospital, Presbyterian Hospital, and Loyola University Medical School. The area is one that will continue to be a problem, unless demolishment and rehabilitation becomes a fact. Age and obsolescence is such that no private money for development purposes will come into the section.

Majority of people are on relief. The area is rapidly deteriorating; badly blighted; and colored expansion is expected to continue north and west. Many demolishments are scattered throughout; also, a number of buildings boarded up. Very little difference exists in price values between 2's and 3's, the 2's being more popular. Property owners who can dispose of their properties to the colored element move west; those who cannot, rent. The Illinois State University Hospital and School of Medicine is located between Taylor and Polk, Wood to Damen. North of Polk is the Cook County Hospital; the Cook County Nurses' Home (exclusively for nurses) lies between Winchester and Lincoln, Polk to Harrison. These buildings adjoin the area and compose what is known as a medical and dental district. Demolishments and medical buildings have thwarted the negro's growth in this particular section. The only hope for this blighted colored area is a few more Jane Adams Projects; or demolishment and rehabilitation on a large scale, undertaken by the city, county or federal authorities in (over) conjunction with owners. The Jane Adams Project, located north of the area between Racine and Loomis, is highly spoken of; but is only a \"flea-bite\" when compared with the large blighted district surrounding it. In the eastern end of the area is the Maxwell Street open-air market, called the \"Ghetto\", which runs for about three blocks east of Halsted. Some attempt is being made to regulate this eye-sore and encourage more sanitary measures; little evidence appears today of this object being attained. East of Ashland are a few white families of Irish and Polish extraction. Damen Street is exceedingly poor. North on Paulina from Roosevelt are colored families on the east. 13th Street, east of Racine, is badly blighted, a mixture of all sorts of buildings, mostly brick 2's and 3's. No mortgage money available anywhere; also few steam-heated rooms. Whenever a residential vacancy exists, vandalism immediately occurs on a large scale, with little or no interference. Years ago this area was all Irish, supplnated by Jews, who gave way to Italians, followed by colored, Mexicans, Greeks, etc. At present, the Chicago Housing Authority is engaged in checking the territory nort of the Jane Adams Project and another project, still alive, hopes to interest city, county, state and private enterprise, inclusing the Mayo Brothers, Rochester, toward the development of a large medical center which would lie between Leavitt and Paulina, Congress and Roosevelt Road. This would mean the demolishment and rehabilitation of a great portion of the area, replaced by hospitals, nurses' homes, attendant retail business establishments, apartment buildings, parks, etc. In this area are the University of Chicago Hospital, the Presbyterian Hospital, the Senn Memorial Hospital, the Loyola University School of Medicine, Rush Medical Laboratories, Chicago College of Dental Surgery, the Rockefeller-McCormick Institue, etc.; and in addition, many churches and other institutions. People in the area live from day to day; many have no money to bury members of their family and collections for funerals are not infrequent. This blighted area will continue to be an increasing menace.","9":{"1":"Southwest Chicago","2":"4th","3":"D-40","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"D41":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6474,41.8671],[-87.6564,41.8669],[-87.6564,41.8713],[-87.6579,41.8712],[-87.658,41.8721],[-87.6603,41.8721],[-87.6604,41.8711],[-87.6607,41.8711],[-87.6609,41.8708],[-87.6608,41.8692],[-87.6593,41.8692],[-87.6592,41.8678],[-87.6618,41.8677],[-87.6617,41.8668],[-87.666,41.8666],[-87.6661,41.8692],[-87.6647,41.8691],[-87.6649,41.8716],[-87.6637,41.8717],[-87.6639,41.8741],[-87.6621,41.8744],[-87.6619,41.8744],[-87.6475,41.8747],[-87.6474,41.8671]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6474,41.8671],[-87.6564,41.8669],[-87.6564,41.8713],[-87.6579,41.8712],[-87.658,41.8721],[-87.6603,41.8721],[-87.6604,41.8711],[-87.6607,41.8711],[-87.6609,41.8708],[-87.6608,41.8692],[-87.6593,41.8692],[-87.6592,41.8678],[-87.6618,41.8677],[-87.6617,41.8668],[-87.666,41.8666],[-87.6661,41.8692],[-87.6647,41.8691],[-87.6649,41.8716],[-87.6637,41.8717],[-87.6639,41.8741],[-87.6621,41.8744],[-87.6619,41.8744],[-87.6475,41.8747],[-87.6474,41.8671]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.8707765625,-87.6525578125],"center":[41.871,-87.656],"boundingBox":[[41.867,-87.666],[41.875,-87.647]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.398,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/D41.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D41/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D41/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"As above","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Predominately Italian, few Mexicans & Greeks"},"b":"Laborer, WPA","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"25%","2":"75%","p":{"2":"Static"},"o":{"2":"Fair"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"December 30, 1899"},"l":{"2":"$15.00-20.00"},"k":{"2":"Down"},"j":{"2":"Poor"},"i":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"4":"December 30, 1899"},"g":{"2":"(2)- $1,750-3,000; (3)- $3,000-3,800"},"f":{"2":"50%"},"e":{"2":"90%"},"d":{"2":"Fair"},"c":{"2":"(Majority are old, spotted 35-55 years- with some around 35 years)"},"b":{"2":"Brick and frame"},"a":{"2":"Two and three-flats"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"January 2, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 4, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Located between Harrison & Roosevelt, Halsted to Ashland, composed almost entirely of foreigners, Italian predominating.

A number of tenement buildings scattered thruout- 6-12 flats, of brick construction.

Some basement flats rent at $6.00 per month. Many demolishments, which are increasing; much vandalism is apparent. Mexicans are scattered thruout, as well as other foreign elements. Future of this blighted district is hopeless unless thru demolishments, buildings are erected similar in character to the Jane Adams Court Bldg Project, for which there is now a large waiting list of tenants. Projects of this nature would be popular, due to excellent quick transportatino into the Loop a short distance away. The Project is now operated by the City of Chgo and is located within the following boundaries:- between Cabrina and Roosevelt, roughly west of Racine to Loomis. Apartments are 3, 4, and 5 rooms and average rent approximately $20.00 per month. This building has helped the area immediately adjacent. It is (over) reported as well-managed; well-kept; and hygenic, although along Roosevelt, between Racine and Throop, are apartments rented to colored people. In the vicinity of Halsted and Blue Island is a concentration of Mexicans and Greeks. The Vernon Park district is extremely decadent, with many frame homes 75-80 years of age. At Polk and Miller was located the heart of Chicago Gangland in the old Capone days, where occurred many killings and injuries amongst Italians, Sicilians and others. Polk Street has many old frame 2's and 3's, a few brick; much rehabilitation required; terribly blighted; the entire area is just as bad, if not worse, than the large colored blighted area where Chicago's three hundred odd thousand colored people live. Cabrina Hospital is located at Racine and Cabrina. At the present time, the Chicago Housing Authority is interested in the territory immeditely north of the Jane Adams Court Building Apartments. On Polk and Ada, facing the park, are many stone party walls. There are no outsiders coming in, and the area is losing in population.

Many old brick, stone, and some frame homes, averaging 60 years, 7-15 rooms, converted into rooming houses. Area is somewhat uniform in type as to class of residences and multi-family. Residences command a better rental bracket than 2's and 3's, due to size and number of rooms; and residential values are firmer than in adjoining area. Little difference exists in values between residences and 2's and 3's, due to adaptability of large homes for use as rooming houses. The Crane Technical School is at Jackson, Van Buren, Oakley and Bell. Jackson Blvd, east from Western Ave., is composed almost entirely of brick and stone residences converted, some 2's and 3's; and becomes lower-grade east of Damen. Part walls exist. Interspersed throughout the area are light manufacturing industries and small retail business stores. On Congress are many brick part walls, a few singles converted, spotted with light manufacturing. West of Wood are a number of 3's, party walls, interspersed with busienss, few frames. Leavitt Street, north of Adams, is exceptionally poor; mixed, singles of brick and 2's and 3's. On Monroe Street, west from Leavitt, are brick and stone residences converted; party walls; many commerical houses. A fair to good demand exists for rooming houses, both for rent and purchase. Much vandalism appears, although some buildings are boarded up. Wieboldt Store, a large chain department store, is at Ogden, Ashland, Monroe and Adams. A cheaper grade of rooming house is east of Ashland; and on Monroe, east of Loomis, are many light manufacturing industries. The area is level; rapidly deteriorating; blighted; and composed of a mixed population. University Hospital is on the northwest corner of Winchester and Congress; and south of Congress, on Winchester to Polk, east to Wood, north to Congress, west to Honore, is located the Presbyterian Hospital, Cook County Hospital, Illinois Research Hospital, University of Illinois Medical School, Rush Medical School and Loyola University Medical School. Sales turnover are fairly active; but, only on long term purchases, 10 per cent down, or $200 or $300 cash. That section west of Ogden is somewhat better than east. Much rehabilitation in the entire area is necessary. * In competition with residences converted into and used as rooming houses, there is little difference in value.","9":{"1":"Southwest Chicago","2":"4th","3":"D-37","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"D33":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6661,41.8813],[-87.6864,41.8812],[-87.6862,41.874],[-87.6861,41.8668],[-87.6912,41.8667],[-87.6913,41.8739],[-87.6914,41.8812],[-87.6915,41.8862],[-87.6918,41.8865],[-87.6909,41.8873],[-87.6902,41.8878],[-87.6895,41.888],[-87.6881,41.8882],[-87.6869,41.8882],[-87.6819,41.8882],[-87.682,41.8873],[-87.6675,41.8873],[-87.6675,41.8867],[-87.6671,41.8862],[-87.6663,41.8863],[-87.6624,41.8862],[-87.6628,41.8852],[-87.6638,41.8837],[-87.6662,41.8854],[-87.6668,41.885],[-87.6667,41.884],[-87.6689,41.884],[-87.6689,41.8832],[-87.6672,41.8833],[-87.6672,41.8823],[-87.6651,41.8823],[-87.6661,41.8813]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6661,41.8813],[-87.6864,41.8812],[-87.6862,41.874],[-87.6861,41.8668],[-87.6912,41.8667],[-87.6913,41.8739],[-87.6914,41.8812],[-87.6915,41.8862],[-87.6918,41.8865],[-87.6909,41.8873],[-87.6902,41.8878],[-87.6895,41.888],[-87.6881,41.8882],[-87.6869,41.8882],[-87.6819,41.8882],[-87.682,41.8873],[-87.6675,41.8873],[-87.6675,41.8867],[-87.6671,41.8862],[-87.6663,41.8863],[-87.6624,41.8862],[-87.6628,41.8852],[-87.6638,41.8837],[-87.6662,41.8854],[-87.6668,41.885],[-87.6667,41.884],[-87.6689,41.884],[-87.6689,41.8832],[-87.6672,41.8833],[-87.6672,41.8823],[-87.6651,41.8823],[-87.6661,41.8813]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.8845466796875,-87.68781074218748],"center":[41.881,-87.682],"boundingBox":[[41.867,-87.692],[41.888,-87.662]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.839,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/D33.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D33/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D33/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Negro","d":"75%","c":{"2":"Italian"},"b":"Lower class- laborers- \"reliefers\"","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"40%","2":"40%","p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Fair"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"December 30, 1899"},"l":{"2":"$5.00-10.00"},"k":{"2":"Static"},"j":{"2":"Poor"},"i":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"4":"December 30, 1899"},"g":{"2":"$1,000-1,500"},"f":{"2":"Low"},"e":{"2":"97%"},"d":{"2":"Poor"},"c":{"2":"50-60 years"},"b":{"2":"Brick- frame"},"a":{"2":"2 and 3 family 4-6 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"January 1, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 7, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is predominantly a negro section, with the exception of Washington Blvd. and Warren Blvd. (although even on these two streets there is considerable negro occupancy) and because of the units there are larger structures, they are operated primarily as rooming houses.

In general, north of the Illinois Central Railroad is somewhat less desirable than the territory lying south of this line and west of the Elevated railway (Westchester Blvd.) Construction shown on the map is entirely two-family brick dwellings. East of this boulevard are almost entirely brick bungalows. LaGrange Road (U.S. Route 45/12) is the western boundary shown on the map, and along the west side of this boulevard is a large cemetery, while at the very northwest tip of the village as shown on the map is a large and active stone quarry. However, these are not of any great influence on present residential development, which is more influenced by the fact that there are no \"eyesores\" near at hand, and direct transportation via the Elevated railway is available. Demand is slow at present, but very likely to improve as this village develops. It is understood that one of the principal developers in the Chicago area has acquired large acreage in Westchester for future development. (over) Heavy assessments originally put on in 1929 have retarded Westchester to a great extent. These approximate $25.00 a foot plus interest, which brings the total to about $40.00 a foot where no payments have been made from the inception of the assessments. Shopping facilities are very remote and limited. Churches are inaccessible, but there is a good small grammar school at the southeast portion of the built-up area. High school is about 4 miles distant in Maywood. The Chicago Title & Trust CO. has been substantially interested in Westchester. Paving bonds are held by the original paving contractor, who is not inclined to reduce his claim. Lots which are readily mortgaged at abotu $1,000 each, due to special assessments, must bring from $2,500-3,000 in order to satisfy all claimants. A recent offer of $1,000 a piece for 40 acres of these lots was not accepted. Provided some compromise can be affected, partially writing off these speical assessments, Westchester should normally see rapid development; which would justify a second grade; but due to present poor convenience and lack of amenities is graded only \"C plus\".","9":{"1":"Westchester, Ill.","2":"High 3rd","3":"C-132","4":"Feb. 1940"}}},"C178":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.8613,41.8346],[-87.8517,41.835],[-87.8513,41.8273],[-87.854,41.8255],[-87.8611,41.8255],[-87.8613,41.8346]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.8613,41.8346],[-87.8517,41.835],[-87.8513,41.8273],[-87.854,41.8255],[-87.8611,41.8255],[-87.8613,41.8346]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.830138671875005,-87.856216015625],"center":[41.83,-87.856],"boundingBox":[[41.825,-87.861],[41.835,-87.851]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.316,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C178.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C178/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C178/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Gradual infiltration Czechs from Berwyn & Cicero","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"2":"Bohemians- Germans"},"b":"Mechanics- artisans","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 1, 1900","2":"Singles- $5,000","3":"Built for owners"},"4":{"b":"January 2, 1900","a":"December 30, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"1; 0"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Terrain is flat and practically treeless, and about 50 oer cent improved.

Somewhat poor demand, railroad influence and age make this third grade.","9":{"1":"Riverside, Ill.","2":"C","3":"July 4, 1900","4":"November 1, 1939"}}},"B106":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.8283,41.8182],[-87.8292,41.8181],[-87.8302,41.8182],[-87.8307,41.8185],[-87.8309,41.8189],[-87.8309,41.8195],[-87.8304,41.82],[-87.8276,41.822],[-87.8271,41.8227],[-87.8264,41.8244],[-87.8262,41.8247],[-87.8248,41.8257],[-87.822,41.8265],[-87.8209,41.827],[-87.8204,41.8269],[-87.82,41.8269],[-87.82,41.8267],[-87.8206,41.8264],[-87.8211,41.8262],[-87.8214,41.8259],[-87.8215,41.8255],[-87.8214,41.825],[-87.821,41.8245],[-87.8204,41.8241],[-87.8201,41.8239],[-87.8201,41.8234],[-87.8202,41.8229],[-87.8207,41.8224],[-87.8219,41.8217],[-87.8231,41.8211],[-87.8246,41.8206],[-87.8253,41.8204],[-87.826,41.8202],[-87.8267,41.8194],[-87.8274,41.8187],[-87.8283,41.8182]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.8283,41.8182],[-87.8292,41.8181],[-87.8302,41.8182],[-87.8307,41.8185],[-87.8309,41.8189],[-87.8309,41.8195],[-87.8304,41.82],[-87.8276,41.822],[-87.8271,41.8227],[-87.8264,41.8244],[-87.8262,41.8247],[-87.8248,41.8257],[-87.822,41.8265],[-87.8209,41.827],[-87.8204,41.8269],[-87.82,41.8269],[-87.82,41.8267],[-87.8206,41.8264],[-87.8211,41.8262],[-87.8214,41.8259],[-87.8215,41.8255],[-87.8214,41.825],[-87.821,41.8245],[-87.8204,41.8241],[-87.8201,41.8239],[-87.8201,41.8234],[-87.8202,41.8229],[-87.8207,41.8224],[-87.8219,41.8217],[-87.8231,41.8211],[-87.8246,41.8206],[-87.8253,41.8204],[-87.826,41.8202],[-87.8267,41.8194],[-87.8274,41.8187],[-87.8283,41.8182]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.82359296875,-87.82346015625],"center":[41.822,-87.825],"boundingBox":[[41.818,-87.831],[41.827,-87.82]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.148,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/B106.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B106/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B106/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"No","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"2":""},"b":"Executives- professional- average income $12,000","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 1, 1900","2":"Detached singles $30,000","3":"Built for owners"},"4":{"b":"January 1, 1900","a":"December 30, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"0;0"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"The area is a flat, wooded peninsula with a narrow strip of forest preserve encircling it.

It has been on the down grade for some time. An effort, however, is being made by improvement clubs, bankers, and brokers to prevent further decline. Captains have been appointed to many blocks in an endeavor to instill a pride of ownership and see what can be done toward painting and rehabilitating some of these old homes which, in the case of frame, average 50 yrs., and brick 35. There are colored people two blocks to the north. Between Ashland and Racine, between 71st and 74th (which is the younger section) 95 per cent are single homes; 80 per cent frame, with many large apartments of 6-24 units scattered throughout on the corners. Many old frames in the area are being converted into 2-family homes. Between 63rd and 74th, Ashland to Racine, 98 per cent are owner-occupied. There are some brick 3's of somewhat newer constructinon in the price bracket of $7,000. Many homes are of brick construction, some built below the street. Between 63rd and 75th, Halsted to Racine, conditions are somewhat similar to the aforesaid, with the exception that there are about a dozen colored families on Carpenter and Aberdeen between 65th and 66th- very spotted. Between 64th and 67th, Stewart to Yale, is probably the best residential district in the area, with some frames as high as $8,000. Large apartment construction in the area was stopped during depression, but is expected to be resumed. Something drastic ultimately must be done. The area should be rebuilt with better homes; there are numbers of them of cheap construction which can easily be demolished. East of Wentworth to State is somewhat identical as to (over) type of building. The better part of the area east of Wallace is adjacent to Hamilton Park between 71st and 74th. The consistently best street in the whole area is Halsted Avenue. Eggleston, north from 65th, has many frame singles, 60-70 years old, very spotted. At 69th and Ashland are big streetcar barns and yards- detrimental. Section aaround 71st Pl., 72nd, and 72nd Pl., and 73rd, west of Racine to Ashland, presents a somewhat better appearance. Schewbridge Field, a large play field, lies south of 74th east of Racine. Stewart Street, south of 74th, as many old apartments. On the east side, between 74th and 73rd, are many party-wall buildings, with brick both in front and rear and frame in the middle. Many poor shacks on this street. South on Lowe from 63rd are coal yards. On 66th, west of Wallace, are many row houses, spotted with mixed constructino. Morgan Street, going north from 69th to 63rd, has recently been widened and an entire new street put down. Many poor frames. The street is now a high-speed highway- detrimental. 63rd and Halsted is said to be the busiest business district in Chicago outside of the Loop. On the west side of Loomis, facing Ogden Park, are some fair homes, with a few two's. This entire area is extremely spotted with old construction of all kinds, with a decidedly poor general, congested appearance. About 75 per cent of the district are two's, many of these 6-7 rooms. Around Normal Parkway are better grade homes and apartments with a better rent bracket. The section south of 75th, east of Harvard to State, is somewhat better than some parts of the area. Singles and 2's of brick construction are not so old, but a few old frames are spotted throughout.","9":{"1":"South Chicago","2":"D","3":"March 23, 1900","4":"December 1, 1939"}}},"D74":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6201,41.7727],[-87.6254,41.7727],[-87.6255,41.7753],[-87.6202,41.7753],[-87.6201,41.7727]]],[[[-87.6158,41.7802],[-87.6257,41.7801],[-87.6256,41.7831],[-87.6264,41.8165],[-87.6264,41.8191],[-87.6268,41.8312],[-87.6074,41.8313],[-87.603,41.8252],[-87.607,41.8235],[-87.6068,41.8025],[-87.6162,41.8023],[-87.6159,41.7857],[-87.6158,41.7802]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6201,41.7727],[-87.6254,41.7727],[-87.6255,41.7753],[-87.6202,41.7753],[-87.6201,41.7727]],[[-87.6158,41.7802],[-87.6257,41.7801],[-87.6256,41.7831],[-87.6264,41.8165],[-87.6264,41.8191],[-87.6268,41.8312],[-87.6074,41.8313],[-87.603,41.8252],[-87.607,41.8235],[-87.6068,41.8025],[-87.6162,41.8023],[-87.6159,41.7857],[-87.6158,41.7802]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.774,-87.6228],"center":[41.809,-87.618],"boundingBox":[[41.773,-87.627],[41.831,-87.603]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":2.877,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/D74.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D74/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D74/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Negro","d":"December 31, 1899","c":{"2":""},"b":"Laborer, relief, etc.","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899","p":{"2":"Static- up"},"o":{"2":"Good"},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":"(4R) $35.00-45.00; (5R) $40.00-50.00; (6R) $45.00-60.00; (7-8) $50.00-75.00"},"k":{"2":"Static- down"},"j":{"2":"Good up to above"},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":"(2) $2,300-5,500; (3) $2,700-7,000"},"f":{"2":"December 30, 1899"},"e":{"2":"December 31, 1899"},"d":{"2":"Fair- good"},"c":{"2":"40-50 years"},"b":{"2":"Brick"},"a":{"2":"A few 2's only; ap't blgs; 3's 6's and up"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"December 31, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"February 17, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Located between 35th and 67th, west of Cottage Grove to State, a blighted area, 100 per cent negro, predominantly apartment buildings; 3's, 6's and up, few 2's. Single homes are of the 6-10 room type, average age 40 years. In this area under construction is the Ida B. Wells US Housing Project, extending from 37th to 39th between South Parkway and Cottage Grove. This proejct is expected to house 1,662 negro families and, of course, will be taken off the tax rolls with the exception of taxes for police, fire and school purposes. This venture has the realtors guessing as to what the ultimate result will be when so many of this race are drawn into this section from the already negro-blighted district; particularly its effect on the section east and south of Cottage Grove, and to park and water frontage on Lake Michigan. Already Washington Park at the south, a very fine park, has been almost completely monopolized by the colored race. Criticism is heard of the locatino of the proejct, some believing it should have been located north of Oakwood and west of Indiana in order to keep the colored influence as far as possible from further encroaching on park and lake water frontage. Others believe that a location south of 35th, extending (over) to Garfield Boulevard between State and the Rock Island RR, would have been preferably and a large fire hazard eliminated; property adjoining the railroad used as a playground, and landscaped with trees, shrubs, etc. NOTE: At the southeast corner of South Parkway and 60th, a brick apartment house of at least 24 flats in a restrited area is reported as owned by Joe Louis. * A small colored B&L organization, the Illinois Federal B&L, is located at 62 E. 47th St. *Three's on South Parkway and Michigan Avenue would run up to $10,000. A remodeling of buildings, stores, etc., by property owners on State Street would have resulted; and the cost of the project less. Rooms in a housing project should be in keeping with the average pockets of the neighborhood, which is said to be from $4.50 to $5.00 per room. With approximately 6,500 colored people moving into this district, it is evident they cannot be closed in; they must have an outlet; and the problem of keeping park and water frontage close by reasonably free of them will be difficult to surmount. The trend of the colored people will no be accelerated toward this park and water frontage, which many people consider could have been avoided had it been located west of Indiana. That section of the area between 35th and 39th, Cottage Grove to Lake Park Avenue, is restricted to whites; but, there are a number of colored families on Ellis Avenue between 37th and 35th, and it is believed (particularly since the advent of the housing project) that this entire section will ultimately go colored, which will increase the number of colored people using the lake front. Washington Park is already doomed. Throughout the entire area aer many vacant lots for which there is no market, due in part to the class of inhabitant and age of improvements. Rehabilitation also is a negligible factor. Instead of demolishing or rehabilitating some of these properties, it might be better to dispose of them than increase vacant property which has little value today. An organization known as the Hyde-Park-Kenwood Protective Organization is endeavoring to keep that section south of 35th to Pershing, east of Cottage Grove (which is restricted) white; but, with at least 25 colored families already in, white people hesitate to buy or rent- colored people will. South of 35th to Marquette, east of State, homes and flats are of a better type; also a better class of colored inhabitant. On Michigan, south of 55th are a number of large, 3-story, brick construction residences. On South Parkway, between 61st and 63rd east to Cottage Grove, are some large apartment buildings being taken over by colored people. Between 66th and Marquette, east of State, is a small section of comparatively good brick bungalows and 2's, some frames. Here a better class of colored people reside. There is nothing for sale or rent, and many applicants for both. This section is fairly old, however. Washington Park on the southeast of the area is almost 90 per cent used by negroes. It is one of the better city parks, with good swimming pools. The pools are so popular in summer time that the colored children are allowed in for one hour only at a time, when a new shift occurs. At South Parkway and 45th is a substantial new building being erected to hosue the Metropolitan Funeral Parlors and Insurance Organizations- all colored. The first settlement of the colored people was south of 22nd to 47th, west of State to Wentworth. The next movement was west of Michigan, where they joined forces at State. Michigan Avenue and South Parkway were the last to go colored about 15 years ago. The rapid development in South Chicago in the 20's of new subdivisions, homes, apartments, etc., caused a vacation of buildings on a large scale, and colored people moved in. The Stockyard Boom during the war is estimated to have brought in about 10,000 families from the South; and in the area at present under discussion, together with adjoining area, is a colored population estimated between 300,000 and 350,000. South of Washington Park sales of properties are said to be taking place to Jews and others, who hold title and rent to colored families. No mortgage money available north of 63rd, between Cottage Grove and Halsted. One of the problems is to find means of helping these people aid themselves. Already colored people are in various businesses, but the majority of the business is controlled by Jews. Our contract broker exhibited a list of approximately 500 applications at present on file from responsible colored people looking for homes to purchase; and no matter how small a flat is, it is usually rented to from eight people and up, who sleep in shifts.* If a responsible mortgage corporation, building and loan or otherwise, composed of colored people could be established it would aid rehabilitation and the turnover of all properties. Property values and rents have increased since 1935 an estimated 30 per cent, but only to colored people. Large apartment buildings are located on Michigan, Indiana, Prairie, Calume and South Parkway south of 47th; also north of Washington Park between Cottage Grove and South Parkway, between 43rd and 51st, with a sprinkiling of singles. 2's, 3's and 6's are located on Wabash, Indiana, Prairie and Calumet between 35th and 63rd. On the corners are the larger buildings; at Wabash and Garfield is the Schulte Bakery (Butternut Bread) industry. Transportation good. The center of this huge colored area is located att 47th and South Parkway. From this hub the colored business activity radiates. It is believed that, unless various rel estate protective associations are strong enough to restrict the colored people, ultimately they will spread over that territory east of Cottage Grove between 39th and 47th. Between 35th and 55th, along South Parkway (formerly Grand Boulevard) are many high-grade residences and apartments. At one time many of Chicago's elite presided here. At Bowen Avenue and Cottage Grove was located the first Walgreen Drug store organization. At 49th and South Parkway is the Corpus Christi Catholic Church, at one time a wealthy, high-grade parish, now ministering almost entirely to colored people. At 61st and Michigan is the St. Columbanus Catholic church, to which the same has happened; and again a similar experience has happened to the Holy Angels Catholic church on Oakwood and Vincennes. At 39th and Hampden is a large apartment building with over 100 apartments. A bad section of the area exists between 51st and 59th on Calumet and Prairie, where the moral influence is far from good. It is emphasized that one of the most important necessities is to provide a means of financing these colored homes so that they may be rehabilitated; provide a larger turnover of property; and hold these people within the area. East of State rooms are steam-heated; west of State, stove heated.","9":{"1":"South Chicago","2":"D","3":"March 14, 1900","4":"January 1, 1940"}}},"D71":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6445,41.7797],[-87.6642,41.7794],[-87.6645,41.7867],[-87.6646,41.794],[-87.6596,41.7941],[-87.6547,41.7942],[-87.645,41.7943],[-87.6445,41.7797]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6445,41.7797],[-87.6642,41.7794],[-87.6645,41.7867],[-87.6646,41.794],[-87.6596,41.7941],[-87.6547,41.7942],[-87.645,41.7943],[-87.6445,41.7797]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.786908203125,-87.652086328125],"center":[41.787,-87.655],"boundingBox":[[41.779,-87.665],[41.794,-87.644]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":1.026,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/D71.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D71/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D71/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"As above, including negro","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"2":"Mixed, Irish, Italian"},"b":"Laborer, lower salary bracket","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899","p":{"2":"Static"},"o":{"2":"Fair up to $45.00"},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":"$35.00-45.00"},"k":{"2":"Static- down"},"j":{"2":"Fair up to $5,250"},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":"$3,500-5,500"},"f":{"2":"December 30, 1899"},"e":{"2":"December 30, 1899"},"d":{"2":"Fair"},"c":{"2":"40-50 years"},"b":{"2":"Frame and brick"},"a":{"2":"Mostly 2-flats"}},"3":{"1":"January 9, 1900","2":"Sgles; brick 5-7R; $8,000","3":"Owners"},"4":{"b":"","a":"January 3, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 6, 1900"},"6":"Limited, 6% FHA B&L","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Located west of Halsted to Ashland, between Garfield and 63rd, many foreigners, Irish and Italian predominant.

On 42nd Place and Ellis, between 40th and 42nd, multiple units predominate. On Oakenwald are some frame and brick singles, party walls, apartments and rooming houses. On Lake Park Avenue are many old homes with stone fronts, some frame 2's, and brick buildings with party walls; singles predominating on both streets. Between 39th and 41st are several old showplace homes. At 39th and Oakland Blvd is the Green Gables Hotel, and some party-wall homes. 39th and Cottage Grove is a semi-blighted section.

At Drexel and E. 45th are some old sandstone homes and rooming houses; north of here on Drexel, party walls, rooming houses and flats, etc. On Ellis are apartment hotels, party walls, frame homes (especially south of 42nd) where there are a number of old stone fronts set back from the street. North of 45th and Berkley are many stone 8-10-12 room rooming houses, some of these 60-70 years old. There are some detached residences between 41st and 42nd on Berkley. West of Cottage Grove is a large colored area extending south to 51st, which is detrimental to that section of the area south of 45th to 51st west of Drexel. There has been considerable vandalism on Drexel south of 39th to 43rd; this is not so apparent south of 43rd to 47th. This is due (over) to the colored element.

From 97th Street south between Vincennes and Carpenter Streets are many frame homes and the oldest part of the area is between 100th and 106th Street, between Vincennes and Morgan. Foreign people are largely concentrated south of 103rd Street. This is partly due to the convenience with which they may reach their place of employment at the Chicago Bridge and Iron Works west of Throop. This industry, by the way, is at present erecting two large new steel buildings. There are many vacant lots throughout the area which is also quite spotted. They have all utilities, pavements, necessary churches and schools. There have been no new assessments for years. They have fair transportation only. Colored people are in that section immediately south of 108th and some Colored families are already located north of 101st to 97th Street between Cenoa and Carpenter.

There are many very poor homes in the area south of 1103rd, not at all modern and much rehabilitation is necessary throughout all the area, especially painting. In the northern part of the area between 96th and 97th are some new brick homes and 97th to Genoa St., a poor frame house street. Genoa Street itself presents a run-down appearance. On May Street, running south from 99th Street homes are of a better appearance, a mixture of brick and frame bungalows in the $4,000 to $6,000 category. On 107th Street, running west from Halsted is much vacant property turned into truck gardening especially in the south as far as May Street. 107th Street is an exceedingly poor street. And on May Street north of 107th are old frame bungalows of inexpensive construction. Much painting is required and the area south of 103rd can be considered to be inferior to that part of it on the north.","9":{"1":"Washington Heights","2":"D","3":"April 17, 1900","4":"October 25, 1939"}}},"D89":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.5952,41.7587],[-87.5942,41.7624],[-87.5926,41.7624],[-87.5927,41.7565],[-87.5954,41.7565],[-87.5962,41.7564],[-87.598,41.7486],[-87.5981,41.7489],[-87.5985,41.7494],[-87.5987,41.7494],[-87.5997,41.7494],[-87.5997,41.7512],[-87.5997,41.7514],[-87.5991,41.7514],[-87.5992,41.7532],[-87.5994,41.757],[-87.6019,41.7571],[-87.6019,41.7551],[-87.6026,41.755],[-87.6028,41.7548],[-87.6053,41.7549],[-87.6052,41.7584],[-87.6079,41.7584],[-87.6077,41.7659],[-87.5976,41.7585],[-87.5952,41.7587]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.5952,41.7587],[-87.5942,41.7624],[-87.5926,41.7624],[-87.5927,41.7565],[-87.5954,41.7565],[-87.5962,41.7564],[-87.598,41.7486],[-87.5981,41.7489],[-87.5985,41.7494],[-87.5987,41.7494],[-87.5997,41.7494],[-87.5997,41.7512],[-87.5997,41.7514],[-87.5991,41.7514],[-87.5992,41.7532],[-87.5994,41.757],[-87.6019,41.7571],[-87.6019,41.7551],[-87.6026,41.755],[-87.6028,41.7548],[-87.6053,41.7549],[-87.6052,41.7584],[-87.6079,41.7584],[-87.6077,41.7659],[-87.5976,41.7585],[-87.5952,41.7587]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.76091171875,-87.60515078125],"center":[41.758,-87.601],"boundingBox":[[41.749,-87.608],[41.766,-87.593]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.332,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/D89.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D89/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/D89/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"No","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"2":"Italian"},"b":"Petty racketeers- bums- fruit pedlars","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"December 30, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 7, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Area is flat with few trees.

Elizabeth St., facing Fort Dearborn school, is mixed frame and brick bungalows and 2-flats, somewhat cheap home construction. On Ada, except at the corners, are bungalows between 90th and 91st; between 91st and 92nd, 3's and 4's-- then bungalows between 92nd and 95th, with few 2's of brick. On Loomis, from 95th north, mixed frame and brick bungalows of good and inferior construction, few 4's. (over) There is a large apartment at 94th, and between there and 90th going north, are mixed frame and brick bungalows. Good little business district between 90th and 89th. Some big apartments at 90th and Bishop, with frame and bungalows- old; betweenn 91st and 92nd, on Bishop, are some large 6's. From 92nd south, all 3's on the east and large 24, one 6, some 3's going south. On Laflin, majority are on 6's. As a matter of fact, west of Loomis, apartments are in the majority. On Justine is much vacant property; some 3's running north from 95th. Between Ada and Loomis, construction appears to be poor frame bungalows. A fair \"B\" grade. NOTE: West of Vicennes, well over 80 per cent of properties are restrictred to Whites.

Halsted Street, a main thoroughfare running north and sotuh, with much vacant land for one-half block on either side, has recently had installed a large sewer built from public funds. East of Halsted is a section known as the Fernwood District. Transportation in this area has not been good, but recently a new bus line has been opened on Halsted Street, and also on 95th Street at the north, and since this has occurred, there has been more interest taken in this area. Present indications are that it will develop slowly. There have been no assessments for some years, but there are many unpaid from former years. North of 99th Street the area is quite sparsely settled. East of Vincennes is approximately one-half restricted to Whites, and property lying east of Vincennes Avenue is somewhat more difficult to move than that lying on the west. Practically all homes on Halsted north from 103rd Street are frame. On Peoria between 96th and 99th Streets are a number of brick bungalows; continuing south of 101st Street frames predominate (over) and south of 102nd Street bricks predominate again. On Sangamon, north of 103rd, are many brick singles. There is much vacant property between 101st and 100th Streets. Lots are mostly 25 foot. Development of this area should be somewhat better from now on due to improved transportation and the fact that the large sewer on Halsted Street is now in. The district is comparatively new and it is likely to develop into a moderate priced area of homes not exceeding $7,500, as the neighborhood does not justify anything better. The trend of growth is to the east. Halsted Street is zoned for business.","9":{"1":"Washington Heights","2":"C","3":"September 11, 1900","4":"October 25, 1939"}}},"C258":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6334,41.7071],[-87.6334,41.705],[-87.6381,41.7049],[-87.6399,41.7049],[-87.6414,41.7049],[-87.6414,41.7029],[-87.641,41.6928],[-87.641,41.6925],[-87.6423,41.6925],[-87.6423,41.6945],[-87.6425,41.7052],[-87.6428,41.7071],[-87.6431,41.716],[-87.6338,41.7161],[-87.6334,41.7071]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6334,41.7071],[-87.6334,41.705],[-87.6381,41.7049],[-87.6399,41.7049],[-87.6414,41.7049],[-87.6414,41.7029],[-87.641,41.6928],[-87.641,41.6925],[-87.6423,41.6925],[-87.6423,41.6945],[-87.6425,41.7052],[-87.6428,41.7071],[-87.6431,41.716],[-87.6338,41.7161],[-87.6334,41.7071]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.70989179687502,-87.63821210937499],"center":[41.709,-87.639],"boundingBox":[[41.692,-87.643],[41.716,-87.633]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.424,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C258.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C258/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C258/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"2":"December 30, 1899"},"b":"Mixed, laborer, business and professional","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 5, 1900"},"6":"Ample 5%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is sometimes referred to as the Fernwood section.

However, most of the inhabitants still work in the Pullman Co. industry. Cottage Grove, a through business street, runs north and south on the west.

In the north end of this area there are several three flats. This is the most desirable portion. There are many foreclosures throughout the area, and some 3 flats have sold as low as $9,500. Prices have stiffened in the past two years since many of the foreclosed properties have been sold off. In 1935 it was next to impossible to get an offer; all were for sale. However, generally, the mortgage plus taxes and interest amounted to more than the value of the buildings, and accordingly there were not many sold until foreclosure caused the redution in price. The area was built about the peak with easy money and liberal financing and small equities. This was speculative construction, and 3 flats originally sold from $25,000 to $26,000. The area becomes less desirable near the railroad, and the best portion on the other hand is along Blackstone, Dante, and Harper. Shops, schools, and churches are reasonably convenient, but poor transportation has hurt the area. About 50% improved at present. It is expected that further building will come in here, and the future may possibly be upward. B&L's lend 70 per cent of the appraisal at 5% interest and 2% commission.

It is sometimes referred to as the \"Ridge\", which boundaries are approximately from 91st to 119th between the Rock Island Suburban and Western Avenue (the highest point on Cook County is at 111th and Hoyne). In this area of Beverly Hills, approximately 25 per cent of the properties are valued at in excess of $25,000- some of them as high as $75,000 to $100,000. The inhabitants are of high grade and the population stable. Many of the homes here were purchased in the inflation period, and a large proportion are mortgaged. For the most part, lawns, shrubs and trees are quite numerous and there is ample evidence of good up-keep. 95th Street, on the north, is zoned for business. Between 103rd and 107th north to 104th, and a very large apartment building located on the northeast corner of 104th and Wood. There are also some apartments on Claremont (which is zoned for apartments) between 103rd and (over) 107th; and on Longwood Drive on the east, between 108th and 110th. The principal development of this area has occurred since 1900 and, for the most part, was on Longwood Drive and adjacent thereto, between 103rd and 95th. Between 103rd and 107th, on Seeley Avenue, are some old homes of 25 to 30 years of age. Bell, Oakley and Claremont, for about two blocks north of 107th, is a substantial brick bungalow neighborhood. Damen Street north from 101st has a somewhat newer development- then tapers off to the north with an older type cost home. Seeley Street, south of 95th to 99th, is not quite as good as that portion of it from 99th south to 101st. Hoyne, north of 103rd, is a mixture of stucco, frame and brick; quite old for one block and then developing into much better homes as far north as 95th. South of 104th on Claremont are some brick two-flats. North on Bell and Leavitt from 107th is all built up with good, substantial homes. Seeley north of 107th, is somewhat older with several stucco and frame between 105th and 103rd; and Longwood south from 103rd is a mixture of old frame and brick homes located considerably away from the street, almost entirely on the west side. These homes are not so substantial between 106th and 107th. At the northwest corner of 107th and Longwood south from 103rd is a large old home that probably cost around $100,000, which has been converted into a girls' private schools. This apparently was done against the zoning ordinance but is an example of what happens to some of these old homes. There have been approximately 50 to 75 new homes; 6-8 rooms; brick; and in the price category of $10,000-15,000 built in the area during the past year. Thsi new construction has taken place, for the most part, in the western section, to which there is a trend. It is well to bear in mind that there are no restrictions against the sale to negroes of property north of 107th in the area west of Vicennes. To the southeast, between 107th and 115th, there is an extensive colored district which lies between Vicennes and Morgan Street. Beverley Hills area enjoys a good turnover of property, although the market can be said to be a buyer's. It is also believed to have a comparatively small percentage of homes free of encumbrance. The majority of people residing here work in the Loop district of the city. The area enjoys good schools, shopping facilities and transportation; and a high degree of ownership is evident.

The area is at least 45 or 50 years old, and is strictly a residential one of a conglomerated mixture of almost every conceivable type of home. Occupied by people of very moderate means with an average income of those employed of $1,500 per year. There are no manufacturing industries and during the depression many people were on relief in this section. It is one of the sections of Chicago where there are no building restricttinos against framehomes. During the last few years sewers and pavement have been put in by public funds. This absorbed many laborers living on relief, and has been the means of improving the section with some new frame construction of inferior type. The trend of this new building is between Kedzie Avenue and the Ridge Country Golf Club between 103rd and 108th where about two dozen new 1 1/2 and 2 story frames have been built of cheap construction. At 108th there are a few scattered new homes among the very old ones, all very inferior. North of 111th, west of Homan for a few blocks are about 24 new frame homes scattered throughout the area as far north as 108th, nearly all 1 and 1 1/2 frame, on all sizes of lots, and (over) different types of construction; throughout the entire area there are only a few moderate brick homes. There is a new public school recently constructed on the east side of Homan and between 108th and 109th. On 108th east of Homan and west of Kedzie is much vacant property. South of 115th on Homan is a somewhat better grade of home of mixed frame construction. South of 111th on Kedzie, an old part of the area, are some very old homes without basements built on posts. The whole area is on level prairie land. The main street running north and south is Kedzie. The area can be considered to be without much future and one where people go in order to obtain a cheap home over their heads. Situated about 13 miles south of the Loop immediately south of Evergreen Park, the Ridge Country Golf Club lies to the northeas, and adjoining to the east are Mount Greenwood and Mount Olivet Cemeteries, and to the southeast Mount Hope Cemetery.

There is extensive vacant property south of 107th to 111th between Western and California and also south of 111th to 113th west to Rockwell. In this area there is some new construction interspersed with old brick bungalows and an occasional 3-flat building. Between 107th and 111th west of Rockwell, there is new construction; 2-story bricks, $6,000-6,500, FHA insured, built for speculation and sold. South of 108th to 111th, east of Rockwell, the area is somewhat older with a miscellaneous lot of old frames and low-priced brick bungalows. Due to the cemetery on the west, values in the area will tend to depreciate. West of Western to Rockwell, south of 111th, is a poor section in process of development, with some fair construction. There is a good Roman Catholic church and school in this area, which gives it a possibility of a future better development as far as Rockwell. 111th Place is an old, declining sectino of frame homes. 111th Street is zoned for business, as well as 95th and 119th. In this Southwest Chicago area, that is; that portion of it between 95th and 119th lying between California and Halsted Street, there is too much property set out for future business development. The adjoining properties are one-family home areas, for the most part, and if more of this had been zoned for apartments, it might have been better. The area north of 103rd between Western and California is platted but not developed. on the south side of 107th at Rockwell is a manufacturing insulating plant. The oldest part of this area is from 109th to 113th. Going west on 107th from Western Avenue to Artesian, one block north and south is vacant. Some new brick bungalows are encountered west of Rockwell, and California is more or less vacant. Campbell Street north from 111th has much vacant property with some two and three-story apartments, and a few single brick bungalows which start at 109th- the street here is unpaved. The new construction is on the west side. At 108th on the east, Campbell has poor frame and cheap construction brick bungalows- on the west side, however, the construction of brick bungalows is of a more substantial character. Artesian Street is a poor one- considerable vacant property and a poor class of old brick and frame home. South of 111th is unpaved. Maplewood going south from 107th and 109th, on the west side, is vacant- the east side has some new brick bungalow construction. The street here is unpaved. North on Talman from 109th, there is considerable vacant property on the east side and on the west are brick bungalows of old construction. At 108th new brick bungalows appear, the east side being vacant. On Washtenaw Street, going south from 107th to 108th, vacant property if on the west side and on the east, brick and frame bungalows. At 109th, homes of older construction of mixed frame, brick and stucco with a few two-flats. Mount Greenwood Cemetery lies to the west. On Fairfield Street there is also much vacant property, the cemetery influence to the west undoubtedly is detrimental. On Maplewood south of 111th, there area few two-family flats. Facing Kennedy Memorial Park, the district between 111th and 115th is known as the old Iglehart district, construction being old-style brick and frame homes. On Western between 112th Place and 113th Place, on the east side, is the Washington Adams Smith Home for elderly people- then mostly small frame bungalows. Future trend in this area is unpromising. Transportation is fair only; schools are good, all utilities and pavements are in. * on 113th there are a few two-family flats, brick construction.

In it reside many of the so-called \"elite\" of the Beverly Hills Morgan Park district. It is considerably older than the area lying to the north; frame buildings here run from 35 to 50 years of age and the bricks of more recent construction, 10 to 20 years. As in Beverly Hills, a high degree of ownership exists. The area enjoys fair to good transportation, all utilities are in, assessments paid, schools good. Here is a well-known section of this a well-known, national military academy, the Morgan Park Military Academy, whose buildings are located between 110th Place and 113th between Hoyne and Bell. The northern section of this area, north of 111th, is the older. Turnover of property is approximately the saame as in the Beverley Hills area. This section has always been considered a high-grade one, but the development of Beverley Hills to the north has had the effect of classifying the area as somewhat inferior to Beverley Hills. Age and obsolescence here is showing its effect, but the area is still desirable. There are some homes in here up to $50,000. (over) At present there is under way a movement to restrict the sale of property to colored people in the district between Rock Island Suburban west to Western Avenue, south of 107th. At present, there is a restriction as to sale to colored people west of Vicennes to the Rock Island Suburban, south of 107th. On Bell Avenue, south of 111th, are many old frame and brick homes; and on Hoyne Avenue south of 111th, homes are predominately frame for one block where it enters Lothair, where buildings are large frame and brick, located on large lots, well kept up with shrubs, trees, etc. On the east side of Longwood, north from 111th, are apartments; and on Seeley south from 107th are high-priced, beautiful brick and stone homes, tapering off south of 108th. West on 110th Place, older buildings appea, mixed iwth new bungalows; and 109th is somewhat older, with some new construction. On Drew Street are fine old homes of brick, frame and stucco. Although this area has attained its peak and property sales are in a buyer's market, the area will continue for some time to house a most desirable type of inhabitant. South of 107th, it will be noticed there are few through streets as far south as 119th. Consequently, there are few tourists or sightseers prowling around, and although this may hurt business, it is a favorable feature toward the continuation of the area as a residential one. Lots are reported to be had at from $1,000-1,500, the average width 35 to 40 feet and 125 feet depth, and some bargains can be obtained.","9":{"1":"Morgan Park","2":"B","3":"May 4, 1900","4":"November 1, 1939"}}},"B126":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6797,41.6845],[-87.6798,41.6874],[-87.6728,41.6876],[-87.6739,41.6835],[-87.675,41.6808],[-87.6755,41.6775],[-87.677,41.6775],[-87.6779,41.6785],[-87.6782,41.679],[-87.6779,41.6795],[-87.6775,41.68],[-87.6776,41.6809],[-87.6777,41.6816],[-87.678,41.6818],[-87.6783,41.6817],[-87.6792,41.6817],[-87.679,41.6823],[-87.6788,41.6832],[-87.6791,41.6838],[-87.6797,41.6845]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6797,41.6845],[-87.6798,41.6874],[-87.6728,41.6876],[-87.6739,41.6835],[-87.675,41.6808],[-87.6755,41.6775],[-87.677,41.6775],[-87.6779,41.6785],[-87.6782,41.679],[-87.6779,41.6795],[-87.6775,41.68],[-87.6776,41.6809],[-87.6777,41.6816],[-87.678,41.6818],[-87.6783,41.6817],[-87.6792,41.6817],[-87.679,41.6823],[-87.6788,41.6832],[-87.6791,41.6838],[-87.6797,41.6845]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.6846640625,-87.6764640625],"center":[41.684,-87.676],"boundingBox":[[41.677,-87.68],[41.688,-87.673]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.158,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/B126.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B126/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/B126/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"2":"December 30, 1899"},"b":"Business and Professional","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 14, 1900","2":"Sgle: 6-8R $9,500-15,000","3":"Owners"},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Ample, 5%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This area is a fairly recent development; average age of about 15 years; almost entirely a home owner neighborhood. Development started here in approximately 1920. The older homes are on Longwood Drive and there are some homes in the area valued in excess of $50,000. It is some distance from schools, and inquiry here for property is somewhat limietd, although the future outlook is promising. The area is also part of Morgan Park, which was annexed to Chicago in 1914. Transportation is good, and the fact that there are no through streets adds to its desirability as a residential section. Sale of property to colored people west of Vicennes to the Rock Island Suburban is retricted north as far as 107th, and it is expected the same restrictions will be completed soon as far west as Western Avenue and south to 119th. It will be seen, therefore, that the area south of 107th, acts as a buffer to Beverley Hills insofar as sale restrictinos to the colored element are concerned. Longwood Drive on the west side has many beautiful homes set away back from the street, with lawns, shrubbery, trees, etc. There is much vacant property for development to the west of the area to the (over) Baltimore & Ohio freight line. At this point, the Mount Hope Cemetery is encountered. There are many vacant lots south of 115th, and most of the new homes south of 115th have been constructed since 1929. On the eastern side of Bell Street are many fine homes, and between 116th and 118th, vacant prpoerty is set out for school purposes. Bell Street changes abruptly at 119th to homes of cheaper construction. North of 119th on east Oakley are expensive homes and some recent substantial development- vacant land is work approximately $35.00 per foot. A Swedish Home for the Aged is located on Bell Street between 114th and 113th; and north of 113th on Oakley, homes are somewhat older. The larger Barker home is located on 116th west of Longwood. On the east side of Longwood, south of 115th, buildings are not so attractive nor substantial as on the west side. They are mostly brick bungalows, with some frame and stucco, especially between 118th and 119th. The large colored area east of Vicennes, now that restrictions as to sale to colored people are in effect, is not considered as detrimental. This area will continue to grow and to be a desirable one.","9":{"1":"Morgan Park. Located So.

Between 97th and 99th, homes are mostly frame and stucco. Between 99th and 100th on Walden are a few stores, etc., and between 100th and 103rd is largely vacant. Between 103rd and 105th are a number of old frame and stucco homes. Between 105th and 107th, on the west side, is more or less vacant. Between 107th and 111th the area faces on the rear Longwood Drive frontage. Hale Street, south of 111th to Edmare, consists mostly of coal yards, and from Edmare to 115th on the west side are four apartment buildings, viz., 3 two's and 1 six. From 115th to 119th there are a few two-unit brick apartments and some 5-room bungalow type buildings about 20 years old. The whole area acts as a distinctive bumper, together with the Rock Island railroad bisecting it north and south, from the old and undesirable elements to the east. South of 95th to 97th, and west of Walden to Seeley, is a fairly good residential section of one-family homes; 6-9 rooms and 20-35 years of age. This particular (over) section is part of what was originally known as the Longwood district. The area has all improvements and pavements, good transportation, easy access to schools and parks. There are old frames on Walden Parkway near 103rd. On Longwood Drive north of 103rd are large old brick homes on the west side, frame being in the majority on the east side. North of 99th, frames predominte on both sides of Longwood. This is approximately where the original development occurred. South of 96th is a large field house, swimming pool, etc., under the control of the Chicago Park Board. South of 95th on Winchester are old frame and stucco singles. These extend for two blocks, where a better quality of home develops. South of 95th and Seeley is a large apartment building. North of 119th on Hale is a cheap brick bungalow area on narrow lots.

The majority of the workers are employed with the Acme Steel Co., the Ford Motor Co., and the steel mills of South Chicago area. The future trend is uncertain. There is no new development expected. The town has no zoning ordinance, the only reason why it should grow is from the overflow from the city of Chicago, immediately to the north. This area is practically all built up. There are very few homes for sale. It is very spotted, and the town itself is no attraction for anybody who desires anything better. There are no homes over $10,000 in the entire town. There are railroads all over the place, and much noise and smoke. The Chicago anad Eastern Railroad removed their yards about ten years ago from Dolton to Danville, Illinois. At that time they employed about 1,400 men, and they used to work 42 engines in the yards. Now the number of employes is between 60 and 70.

Tehy have fair transportation. Also a park. Special assessments are heavy and mostly past due. Fully 50 per cent of the families living east of the river are Polish. There are no Negroes. There are many WPA workers and many truck gardeners. Most people residing here shop in Hammond, Indiana, to the east. There are no large manufacturing industries except the Burnham Refinery at 139th and Mackinau, but the village is within walking distance of other large manufacturing industries in the Calumet area. For several years the Pressed Steel Car Co. and the Ryan Car Co., to the north, were idle, and the village suffered considerably. It is very spotted with all kinds of buildings from shacks to a few in the $8,000 to $10,000 category. Along South Burnham, facing the Burnham Woods Golf Club are three good homes in the $8,000 to $12,000 category. These are located in the best part of the city.

West of Yates Avenue, and north of Brainard Avenue is some new development. The future of the community looks somewhat better. The Pressed Steel Car Company, a subsidiary of the General American Tank Car Company, has recently purchased the Bus Division of the Gar Wood Industries of Detroit, Michigan, and are moving this industry to Hegewisch. The development along Lake Calumet will also help the community. The trend of new constructino will be directly east of the Ford Plant located east of Torrence Avenue to the northeast of Hegewisch. The future of the town depends entirely on the industrial barometer. About 80 per cent of the foreign population is Polish. During the depression all industries thereto were closed down completely. Due to its proximity to Hammond Indiana, where there is no sales taxed, much business is lost to Hegewisch.","9":{"1":"So.

Rents quoted in two family houses are for unheated units.","9":{"1":"N/A","2":"3rd","3":"C-35","4":"Oct. 1939"}}},"C55":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.7034,41.9686],[-87.7032,41.9646],[-87.7033,41.9646],[-87.7231,41.9647],[-87.7233,41.968],[-87.7284,41.9679],[-87.7284,41.9684],[-87.7285,41.972],[-87.7132,41.972],[-87.7115,41.9731],[-87.7108,41.9736],[-87.7108,41.9737],[-87.7107,41.9741],[-87.7106,41.9742],[-87.7101,41.9745],[-87.7093,41.9748],[-87.7085,41.9748],[-87.7085,41.9749],[-87.7085,41.9755],[-87.7085,41.9756],[-87.708,41.976],[-87.708,41.9761],[-87.708,41.9761],[-87.7059,41.9762],[-87.7059,41.9727],[-87.7042,41.9727],[-87.7041,41.9707],[-87.7034,41.9699],[-87.7034,41.9686],[-87.7034,41.9686]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.7034,41.9686],[-87.7032,41.9646],[-87.7033,41.9646],[-87.7231,41.9647],[-87.7233,41.968],[-87.7284,41.9679],[-87.7284,41.9684],[-87.7285,41.972],[-87.7132,41.972],[-87.7115,41.9731],[-87.7108,41.9736],[-87.7108,41.9737],[-87.7107,41.9741],[-87.7106,41.9742],[-87.7101,41.9745],[-87.7093,41.9748],[-87.7085,41.9748],[-87.7085,41.9749],[-87.7085,41.9755],[-87.7085,41.9756],[-87.708,41.976],[-87.708,41.9761],[-87.708,41.9761],[-87.7059,41.9762],[-87.7059,41.9727],[-87.7042,41.9727],[-87.7041,41.9707],[-87.7034,41.9699],[-87.7034,41.9686],[-87.7034,41.9686]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.969221875,-87.70901562499999],"center":[41.969,-87.714],"boundingBox":[[41.965,-87.729],[41.976,-87.703]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.658,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C55.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C55/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C55/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Lower class Jewish","d":"","c":{"2":"Jewish"},"b":"Middle class and lower middle class","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"60%","2":"20%","p":{"2":"Firm *3rd column on page, unsure where to put information"},"o":{"2":"Good- up to $60.00"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"i":{"4":"(1939-Sept.) $8,500-13,500"},"h":{"4":"17+"},"g":{"2":"$8,000-13,000"},"f":{"2":"50%"},"e":{"2":"98%"},"d":{"2":"Fair- some fairly good"},"c":{"2":"17-25 years"},"b":{"2":"Brick"},"a":{"2":"Three-family; 5-6 rooms"},"m":{"4":"12+"},"l":{"2":"$45.00-62.50"},"k":{"2":"Weak"},"j":{"2":"Fair- up to $11,500"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"200 units","a":"February 9, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"February 28, 1900","a":"February 20, 1900"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Although properties in this section are of substantial appearance and command good rentals, the general trend of the neighborhood is definitely downward because of the marked infiltration of Jewish. This so-called Albany Park section has been Jewish, however, for a period of about ten to fifteen years, but the better families during the past three to five years have been moving into the Rogers Park section, and Albany Park is feeling the infiltration of somewhat lower class Jewish families from Southwest Chicago. There is a sizeable overhang in the area, and a slight tendency on the part of institutions to dump properties, although no wholesale instance of this has occurred as yet. Lawrence and Kedzie are the main shopping streets, but many of the stores are typical fish markets and shoe-string business operations. One reason for the good rentals obtainable is because of excellent elevated transportation ending at Lawrence and Kimball. The higher-priced rentals quoted above in most cases have one and one-half baths. The experience of many institutions in the area is that tenants move very often and considerable reconditioning must be done at least one a year. The grading of the area is penalized because of the class of occupancy, and a very marked downward trend.","9":{"1":"Albany Park","2":"3rd","3":"C-55","4":""}}},"C56":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.6891,41.9796],[-87.6892,41.9782],[-87.6892,41.9782],[-87.6893,41.9781],[-87.689,41.9687],[-87.689,41.9686],[-87.6922,41.9687],[-87.6923,41.9713],[-87.6922,41.9713],[-87.6922,41.9713],[-87.6912,41.9713],[-87.692,41.9726],[-87.6941,41.9726],[-87.6942,41.9734],[-87.6967,41.9734],[-87.6968,41.9753],[-87.6967,41.9753],[-87.6967,41.9753],[-87.6923,41.9753],[-87.6923,41.9758],[-87.6926,41.9796],[-87.6926,41.9796],[-87.6891,41.9795],[-87.6891,41.9796],[-87.6891,41.9796]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-87.6891,41.9796],[-87.6892,41.9782],[-87.6892,41.9782],[-87.6893,41.9781],[-87.689,41.9687],[-87.689,41.9686],[-87.6922,41.9687],[-87.6923,41.9713],[-87.6922,41.9713],[-87.6922,41.9713],[-87.6912,41.9713],[-87.692,41.9726],[-87.6941,41.9726],[-87.6942,41.9734],[-87.6967,41.9734],[-87.6968,41.9753],[-87.6967,41.9753],[-87.6967,41.9753],[-87.6923,41.9753],[-87.6923,41.9758],[-87.6926,41.9796],[-87.6926,41.9796],[-87.6891,41.9795],[-87.6891,41.9796],[-87.6891,41.9796]]]]},"labelCoords":[41.97402343750001,-87.69101093749998],"center":[41.974,-87.692],"boundingBox":[[41.969,-87.697],[41.98,-87.689]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.155,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/full-size/C56.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C56/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/C56/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/IL/ChicagoSection1/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"2":"Mixture"},"b":"Lower middle class","a":{"3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"75%","2":"20%","i":{"3":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"4":"9+"},"g":{"2":"$5,500-7,750"},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":"97%"},"d":{"2":"Fair"},"c":{"2":"35 years"},"b":{"2":"Brick"},"a":{"2":"Two-family; 5-6 rooms"},"p":{"2":"Firm"},"o":{"2":"Good- up to $50.00"},"n":{"5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"4":"16+"},"l":{"2":"$35.00-47.50"},"k":{"2":"Firm"},"j":{"2":"Fair- up to $7,000"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 5, 1900"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a mediocre neighborhood of old frame houses with a few scattered brick two-family units some of which have stone fronts.
