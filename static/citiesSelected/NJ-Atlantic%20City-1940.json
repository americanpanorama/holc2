This is in spite of the fact that most of the beach front and practically all of the portion of the area west of Delancey Place is zoned as \"A\" residence. In addition the lower part of the \"Newton Tract\" is restricted by deed. Since this area was the most desirable on the island prior to the development of Ventnor and Margate, it follows that there are many homes of very large size -some of comparatively substantial age- and others of thoroughly modern vintage. The combination of generally falling prices and deteriorating neighborhood gives these houses a present-day sales value of only small fractions of former cost- probably as low as 25% to 35%. Only two blocks between Atlantic Ave. and the Boardwalk are undesirable - the west side of Columbia and Bartram and Kingston Sts. These are old houses of unattractive type crowded closely together, and useful only as rooming houses (which use is prohibited by restrictions). Recent sales of these have been made as low as $2,000. The Wanamaker family formerly owned a very large mansion fronting of Ventnor Ave. and occupying the of a large city block. Failing in efforts to sell it for any reasonable consideration, the house has been demolished. While it is true -as in all sections on Absecon Island - that values tend to recede with distance from the ocean, there are perhaps none of the larger type located away from the Boardwalk than in other areas. However, with the exception of the two blocks of poor type houses mentioned above, it is still true that the smaller and lower priced dwellings are located several blocks or more from the beach.","9":{"1":"Atlantic City","2":"2nd Low","3":"B-5","4":"4/1/1940"}}},"C4":{"area_geojson":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-74.4653,39.3588],[-74.462,39.3605],[-74.457,39.3546],[-74.4617,39.3523],[-74.4628,39.3537],[-74.4622,39.354],[-74.4647,39.357],[-74.4638,39.3574],[-74.4653,39.3588]]]]},"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-74.4653,39.3588],[-74.462,39.3605],[-74.457,39.3546],[-74.4617,39.3523],[-74.4628,39.3537],[-74.4622,39.354],[-74.4647,39.357],[-74.4638,39.3574],[-74.4653,39.3588]]]]},"labelCoords":[39.35635303630362,-74.4613357913015],"center":[39.356,-74.461],"boundingBox":[[39.352,-74.465],[39.36,-74.457]],"name":"Somers Point - Glyn Neath\r\n","holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.121,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/NJ/AtlanticCity/1940/full-size/C4.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/NJ/AtlanticCity/1940/C4/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/NJ/AtlanticCity/1940/C4/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/NJ/AtlanticCity/1940/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0","c":{"2":"n/a"},"b":"Mixed daily workers- est. income $1,000-2,000","a":{"3":"yes"}},"2":{"1":"100","2":"1 Family - 5-8 rooms","p":{"2":"n/a"},"o":{"2":"n/a"},"n":{"5":"n/a"},"m":{"4":"n/a"},"l":{"2":"n/a"},"k":{"2":"n/a"},"j":{"2":"n/a"},"i":{"5":"n/a"},"h":{"4":"20-35"},"g":{"2":"15-30"},"f":{"2":"Fair up to 2,500"},"e":{"2":"$1,200-3,500"},"d":{"2":"0"},"c":{"2":"$1,200-3,500"},"b":{"2":"90%"},"a":{"2":"20 yrs."}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"-","3":"-"},"4":{"b":"30","a":"4 @ $5198"},"5":{"1":"1 @ $3121","b":"None","a":"36"},"6":"40","7":{"1":"$60.46*","2":"95, $38.09*"},"8":"All facilities.
