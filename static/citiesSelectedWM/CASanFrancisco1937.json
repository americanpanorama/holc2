There are really two parts to the area, and it is deemed best to describe them separately. The North part is the frontage on Marina Boulevard from Buchanan Street to teh Presidio wall at Lyon Street. These lots are generally 30 feet wide and overlook the Bay, with the Marina hills in the background. They face directly on either a park or yacht harbor. Althoguh they occupy \"made land\" which was formerly part of the 1915 Exposition Site, these lots have maintained a value of from $200 to $250 a front foot even through the depression, and the average cost of the homes range from $12,500 to $20,000, with one or two a little more costly. The nieghborhood is very popular, and owing to the limited area, it is anticipated that there will always be good demand for this frontage. The western part of the area is situated upon natural ground, and 25 foot lots predominate. The improvements consist of one and two-story, six to nine-room dwellings, wiht a cost range of from $7,000 to $15,000, and is also considered very desirable residential property. This part of the area borders \"C-7\" which contains a large number of three-story apartments and flats. The break from \"green\" to \"yellow\" is justified by the high character of these multi-unit improvements. This entire area is practically 95% built-up and nearly all owner-occupied by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes ranging from $5,000 to $20,000. Climatic conditions are favorable. Threat of discordant racial infiltration is very remote. Pride of ownership is high, and the demand for property in this section held better than in any other section in San Francisco during the depression. A standard eight-room house in the north part would have sold for $17,500 in 1929, $13,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $17,500. The same home would have rented for $150 a month in 1929, $125 a month in 1933, and $150 now.

The lot sizes range from 30 to 100 feet frontage, and in 1928 some of the choice lots with unobstructed view were valued for as much as $1,000 per front foot. This area is zoned 'first-residential'; however, there are no deed restrictions. This area, starting with an elevation of 350 feet in the southern part, descends to less than 200 feet at its northern boundary. The majority of the sites afford an excellent view of the Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the surrounding hills to the north and east. The east and west streets have favorable grades, but the streets running north and south are more or less precipitous. The area is approximately 85% built-up and practically 100% owner-occupied by professional men and capitalists, having incoems ranging from $10,000 per year up. The majority of the improvements are of the town house and mansion type and are of various types of construction. Buildings in this area range from new to an age of 40 years and have a cost range of from $20,000 to $150,000 or more. Owing to the architectural and structural soundness of its improvements and desirability of location, it is difficult to determine the remaining economic life of this district. None of the older improvements have been allowed to become obsolete, and they have been in many cases entirely remodeled and completely modernized. It is quite possible, owing to its natural advantages and the other factors mentioned, that this district will remain the outstanding residential district of San Francisco for a great many years to come. It is not feasible to estimate the fluctuation in values of a typical house in this district during the past eight years, for two reasons: first, that there is no typical house in this area of the smaller variety and, secondly, in the bottom of the depression there was absolutely no market for property of the predominating type in this area.

This tunnel, 2 1/4 miles long, was completed in 1916 and supplies direct rail transportation from the area known as \"West of the Twin Peaks\" to the City Center and other points. The construction of this tunnel opened up some three or four thousand acres of dormant land into a better-type of restricted sub-division. The average size of lots in this area is 33 1/3 by 100 feet. The street improvements, though costly due to the topography, were not accepted by the city and are being kept in repair by the Forest Hill Associaition, a non-profit corporation made up of property owners within the tract, for the purpose of maintaining streets, landscaping, and generally enforcing the restrictions. This association is functioning well, and the tract and streets are well-maintained. There is a special tax levy of 3/10 of a mill per square foot monthly for maintenance. Most of the residences in this tract are of the two-story, six to eight-room type, their prices ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, protected by deed restriction and zoning to single-family residences only. The tract is approximately 60% built-up and largely owner-occupied with less than 3% vacancy. Portion of this sub-division are convenient to shops, schools, and transportation, while other portions are somewhat removed from transportation facilities. The residents in this area are largely made up of the \"white collar\" class in the middle-salaried brackets and professional and business men, having an income range from $2500 to $7500. Infiltration of inharmonious social elements is not anticipated. This tract was slow to develop; therefore, there are homes ranging in age from new to 25 years, with the majority of the buildings erected within the past 10 years. This area adjoins the Laguna Hona Home for the Aged. This does not constitute a deterimental influence, however, as the grounds are highly landscaped and well-maintained.

It was one of the exclusive districts in San Francisco's early history, some of the old mansions still being used for institutional purposes and lodging houses. It is now largely inhabited by factory workers and laborers, with incomes ranging from $800 to $2400. Many nationalities are represented, but there is no racial concentration, in broad sense of the term. Maintenance is what would naturally be expected in a low-income community. The area is from 50 to 60 years old, and improvements consist of an inharmonious conglomeration of old houses, bungalows, flats, and apartments, sprinkled with shops, makrets, and small industrial establishments. Single-family dwellings, aside from old shacks, have a cost range of from $2500 to $5,000. They consist mainly of frame, row single and multi-family dwellings ranging in age from 8 to 60 years many of them being of the old mansion type. The area is principally zoned second-residential, but many blcoks are given over to business and light industry. The single-family units are 50% owner-occupied, 45% rented, and 5% vacant. School and transportation facilities, together with parks, and recreational areas, are conveniently available. Two factors which constitue detrimental influences are the packing house district which is not far to the eastward and a Southern Pacific Railroad spur track which transverses the area.

It constitutes the western portion of the \"Richmond District\", and is zoned second-residential, with the exception of one block and five half-blocks, zoned first residential, and 37 quarter-blocks on Balboa and Cabrillo Streets zoned for business. A well developed shopping center occupies this zoning. There are no deed restrictions. The area is popular with the medium income group of professional and business me, \"white collar\" workers, and higher-class skilled mechanics and artisans. Annual incomes range from $1800 to $5,000. There is no threat of undesirable racial influences. The eastern part of the area is 90% built-up, tapering off ot 50% in the extreme western portion, being 75% to 80% developed as a whole. Improvements consist of stucco, frame and stucco, row and detached houses and bungalows, costing from $4,000 to $7,000, with a number of two-family flats and small corner apartment houses in the $7,000 to $12,000 cost range. While somewhat heterogeneously developed in spots, maintenance is generally good, indicating a pride of ownership. A few buildings were erected some 30 years ago, but a majority of the property has been improved since 1920. On the northwest boundary of the area, below a bluff, lies the far-framed \"cliff House\" and \"Seal Rocks\"; on the south it joins Golden Gate Park, while to the north is the Lincoln Park Municipal Gold Links. These all add to the attractiveness of the district. Good schools, and churches are conveniently located, and the area, which is densely populated, is served by four car lines to the City Center, which is four or 4 1/2 miles distant. This distance from the down-town district and the time consumed in getting there, is a deterring influence, as is the fog and wind condition which prevails at certain seasons of the year. Although rising land values tend to increase the burden of ownership, the tax situation as a whole is equitable. The classification of this area as \"blue\" does not complete the picture. There are spotted blocks here and there which could be designated \"high yellow\", and on the other hand, there area scattered blocks fronting Golden Gate Park which could be classed as \"low green\". There are also 12 blocks in the northwest section of the area adjoining Sutro Heights and the military reservation, which are hilly and afford a pleasing view of the Pacific Oceas and Golden Gate Park, that are less than 50% improved and give evidence of developing into a higher grade, possibly a \"high blue\" or \"low green\". At present the same general characteristics justify the inclusion of this district in one area, but within ten years it will have to be broken up into a number of separate units. Already parts have reached a peak and are in that static stage which porecedes a decline. Marteksbility in the area is generally good, with values tending upward.

In Sea Clift proper the oldest structure is approximately 18 years old, the bulk of the houses having been built ten years ago. Sea Clift is highly restricted to single-family residences, both by ordinance and deed. The other section is zoned by ordinance only, and a few four-family flats and one or two apartments were built in this district before the zoning ordinance came into effect. This does not have a detrimental influence, however. The appraised values of the residences in Sea Clift range from $9500 to $50,000, and in the area lying to the east, range from $5,000 to $25,000. The area is inhabited largely by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes ranging from $4,000 to $40,000. The income level of around $5,000 predominates. Infiltration of inharmonious racial elements is very remote, and maintenance is of a high order. There are comparatively to vacancies in this area, which is approximately 90% owner-occupied. Schools of all grades are within easy walking distance, transportation facilities are adequate, and parks and recreational areas are nearby. A few of the homes fronting on the ocean to the north have a privately-owned beach.

There are many beautiful single-family residences, both of the two-story and bungalow type, constructed of frame and stucco. This is particularly true of the northwest part of the area bordering \"A-4\", and if it were not for the predominance of apartments and multi-family dwellings, this section would have been made a part of \"B-12\". The situation described accounts for the break from \"green\" to \"yellow\", which occurs where this area adjoins \"A-4\". A small part of this area is situated on \"made\" ground formerly occupied by the 1915 Exposition. Improvements consist of three-story apartments and flats and two-story and bungalow type, single-family, frame and stucco, row dwellings. Many of the single-family residences have distinction and beauty. The single-family dwellings have a cost range of from $6,000 to $12,000, with a large percentage of owner-occupancy and practically no vacancies. In the southern part of the area the dwellings are older, some of them being 30 years or more. Maintenance, however, is of a high order. There is a modern, high-grade neighborhood business center running for four blocks along Chestnut Street, which adds to the convenience and attractiveness of the area. Schools, recreational areas, and transportation facilities are all available, and property in the district is readily marketable. The average age of improvements in the area is less than 15 years, and it is by no means \"definitely decling\". In fact, it is still developing, being not to exceed 90% built up. One possible derrogatory feature lies in the fact that one of the approaches to the Golden Gate Bridge, which will soon be completed, runs through this area. While a \"C\" designation has been given, it should be understood that it is a \"high yellow\". Grading of this area was very difficult, and determination was finally made largely upon the preponderance of income property which it contains. The single blaock bordering the Presidio is teh entrance to that military reservation. While some mortgagee institutions refuse to lend in this territory, they are in the minority, loans being usually eagerly sought for upon maximum terms.

Negotiations are said to be under way by a responsible group of the purchase of Calvary Cemetery for the purpose of sub-dividing it. Should this become an accomplished fact, it will have a very beneficial effect upon this area. This possibility has some bearing upon the grading of this area which is accorded a rating of \"low yellow\". Loan applications in this area are closely scrutinized and are usually made upon a very conservative basis. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $550. The same home would have rented for $60 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $50 now."}},"D2":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-122.4387,37.7712],[-122.4401,37.771],[-122.4434,37.7706],[-122.4435,37.771],[-122.4525,37.7698],[-122.4534,37.7697],[-122.4536,37.771],[-122.4454,37.7721],[-122.441,37.7727],[-122.4412,37.7738],[-122.4413,37.7744],[-122.4425,37.7743],[-122.4424,37.7736],[-122.4505,37.7725],[-122.4539,37.772],[-122.454,37.7729],[-122.4527,37.7731],[-122.4527,37.7732],[-122.4528,37.774],[-122.4526,37.774],[-122.4526,37.774],[-122.4396,37.7757],[-122.4392,37.7739],[-122.4387,37.7712]],[[-122.4477,37.7733],[-122.4479,37.7741],[-122.4524,37.7735],[-122.4525,37.7734],[-122.4523,37.7727],[-122.4477,37.7733]]]]},"center":[37.773,-122.446],"boundingBox":[[37.77,-122.454],[37.776,-122.439]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.167,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/SanFrancisco/1937/full-size/D2.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/SanFrancisco/1937/D2/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/SanFrancisco/1937/D2/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/SanFrancisco/1937/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":"This area of 36 blocks occupies a level section surrounding the Golden Gate Park \"Panhandle\".

The cost range of dwellings is from $7,000 to $12,000. No building in this area is older than five years, and over 50%f were constructed within the past two years. F. H. A. Title II loans have been a large factor in the development of this area, which is inhabited largely by the medium-income \"white collar\" class, professional men, small business owner, and excutives, having incomes ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 or more. Property is protected by single-family deed restrictions and \"first-residential\" zoning. There are no racial threats, and maintenance is of a high order. The area is 95% owner-occupied, with no vacancies and is approximately 60% built-up. Building activity in this area is very brisk, and as the owners of the three sub-divisions are builders and developers, it is logical to assume that the entire area will be 95% developed within the next two years. Property has some view, convenience to schools, transportation, and recreational areas. A parked reservoir adds to the charm of the neighborhood. This is considered the \"hot spot\" of new residential construction in the $8,000 to $12,500 class. Presuming its existence, a standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $13,500 in 1929, $8,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $12,500. The same home would have rented for $110 a month in 1929, $75 a month in 1933 and $95 a month now. The prevalence of high percentage to cost mortgage loans in this area constitutes a detrimental influence sufficient to warrant a designation of \"low green\"."}},"B31":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-122.4378,37.7304],[-122.4362,37.7289],[-122.436,37.7286],[-122.4367,37.728],[-122.4379,37.7256],[-122.438,37.7253],[-122.4398,37.7261],[-122.4413,37.7268],[-122.4415,37.7267],[-122.4452,37.7267],[-122.445,37.7269],[-122.4448,37.7271],[-122.4446,37.7273],[-122.4444,37.7275],[-122.4441,37.7277],[-122.4439,37.7279],[-122.4437,37.7281],[-122.4434,37.7283],[-122.4432,37.7284],[-122.4429,37.7286],[-122.4426,37.7288],[-122.4424,37.7289],[-122.4421,37.7291],[-122.4418,37.7293],[-122.4416,37.7294],[-122.4413,37.7296],[-122.441,37.7297],[-122.4407,37.7298],[-122.4404,37.73],[-122.4401,37.7301],[-122.4398,37.7302],[-122.4395,37.7303],[-122.4392,37.7304],[-122.4385,37.7299],[-122.4378,37.7304]]]]},"center":[37.728,-122.44],"boundingBox":[[37.725,-122.445],[37.73,-122.436]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sqmi":0.091,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/SanFrancisco/1937/full-size/B31.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/SanFrancisco/1937/B31/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/SanFrancisco/1937/B31/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/SanFrancisco/1937/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":"This area of 17 blocks known as Mission Terrace and Colonial Park is 85% built-up and is generally of a level topography.

The tract is well-landscaped and is considered the most popular sub-division in its class. It has an undulating topography with rolling elevations from the east to the west, and the streets are contoured for easy grades and maximum construction for view.

The lots in this sub-division maintained their values even during the depression period. Lots are selling for as high as $5,000, which is approximately the peak. The residents of this tract are made up of professional people, business executives, and a few retired capitalists, having an income range from $5,000 to $40,000. The marketability for property in this area is the highest in the entire district. This is partly due to the high standard of maintenance and proper restrictions taht exist. There are a number of homes being built in this area, and construction loans area eagerly sought by all mortgagee institutions.

This area is located on a rolling knoll and slopes in all four directions, affording an excellent view from many of the sites. The subdivision was placed on the market in 1925 and is about 65% developed. it is an extremely popular section at the present time, and some 50 new homes were erected within its confines during the past year. There are a few steep slopes, but usually the building sites are fairly level, and practically all afford a view. The platting of the area was an admirable piece of engineering.

There area a few more costly houses on some imposing knolls; however, the $8,000 house predominates. The majority of the houses have canvas walls, tile baths, with the latest modern features, most of them of the two-story variety with from six to nine rooms. The area is properly restricted by deed and zoning, and it is 90% owner-occupied, largely by professional people and business executives having incomes of from $4,000 to $10,000. This area is served by bus transportation, and is only fairly convenient to good schools and shopping districts. Marketability was slow just prior to and during the depression. However, it is increasing rapidly and becoming a popular district. With the normal growth that is now existing, it is estimated that this area will be 90% developed within the next two years. The only detrimental influence, other than those indicated, is the seasonal fogs and wind from the ocean, which applies to the entire area comprising the western part of San Francisco. Many F. H. A Title II loans are being made in this area, and competition among mortgagee institutions for them is very keen. This factor is believed to be a potent one in stimulating development in the area. In addition to this, the area has an attractive setting, is being harmoniously developed, and is in the path of normal growth. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $12,500 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $11,000.

The average sixe of the building sites is from 75 to 100 feet frontage. Up to 1935 only two residences were constructed in this tract, and during the past year four additional homes were erected at a cost of from $15,000 to $25,000. This area is creating considerable interest at the present time, and as the restrictions are rigidly maintained, it is believed that development will continue at a moderate rate. The property is located on the western and northern slope of Mt. Davidson, whcih is the highest point in San Francisco, having an elevation of 985 feet. The character of the sub-division is hilly with one or two ravines. A portion of the tract is unplatted and adjoins a 20 acre city park which includes the peak of Mt. Davidson. Residents of this tract are professional men and business executives having incomes in excess of $10,000 per year. The sub-division is somewhat remote from transportation, schools, and stores; however, with its type of inhabitants, this is not considered a serious handicap due to the fact that there are two or more automobiles in each family, with domestic help. This property, adjoining a city park, nestles on the wooded slopes of Mt. Davidson, and having an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean for a distance of 50 miles, forms a picturesque setting for high-class development. A deterring incluence affecting this area is the season of intermittent fogs and winds which is recurrent for three or four months of the year in this section. When this sub-division was placed on the market, the sites were priced from $4,000 to $15,000, according to their size and location. However, no sales were made at these values, and the maximum price obtained to date is $45 per front foot. It is believed that, with the return of normal conditions and a better planned and more aggressive-selling campaign, it will be possible to obtain as much as $7500 for some of the choice sites. Taxes are assessed on a basis of $60 per front foot on the platted portion of the area and at $300 per acre on the unplatted part.

It is occupied by laborers and factory workers with incomes of from $1000 to $2000 and by \"white collar\" workers, city employees, and shop-keepers with incomes ranging from $1500 to $3,000.

Single-family residences range in value all the way from $2,000 to $7500, and consist of varied types of architecture and construction.
