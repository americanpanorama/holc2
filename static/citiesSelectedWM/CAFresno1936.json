It may be observed here that the variance in cost range and age in a city of this size cannot be considered a detrimental influence, as it would be in a metropolitan city.  There are probably 30 new houses being built in this area at the present time, the type of construction being frame, stucco, and brick. The area is zoned for single family residences, and there is no vacancy at the present time. It is well located from the point of view of transportation and educational facilities, as the best car line in the city runs within three or four blocks of any point in the area, and the Fresno High School and Fresno State College are both within a few blocks. Here too it is difficult to define a shrinkage trend during the depression because all the lots before the depression were owned by the development company, which held them until they could be sold to people who were actually going to build on them. There was virtually no sale of improved properties here during the depression. At the present time 60 foot lots are selling for $1,000 to $1,500. There is a sharp difference in the nature of the properties north of Shields Avenue. The three blocks between Shields and Simpson Avenues is much better than the other parts, “C-1”, but as it is such a small area, it was deemed more practicable to extend “C-1” to “A-1” rather than set up a separate “blue” area."}},"A2":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-119.8045,36.764],[-119.8011,36.764],[-119.8011,36.7615],[-119.8034,36.7615],[-119.8035,36.7601],[-119.8043,36.7601],[-119.8046,36.7602],[-119.8046,36.7622],[-119.8045,36.764]]]]},"center":[36.762,-119.803],"boundingBox":[[36.76,-119.805],[36.764,-119.801]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"A","sqmi":0.039,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/Fresno/1936/full-size/A2.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/Fresno/1936/A2/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/CA/Fresno/1936/A2/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/CA/Fresno/1936/","sheets":2,"areaDesc":{"1":"This small area stands out definitely from the solid “blue” area, “B-2”, and its boundaries are well defined, as indicated on the map.

They are of frame, stucco, or brick construction and most of them are two-story structures. There are two or three houses under construction in the area at the present time, and several others have only recently been completed. Thus again illustrates the fact that in a city of this type and size, with the revival of buildings, one finds areas which are already pretty well built up suddenly becoming active where there are still vacant lots. The area is practically 100% owner-occupied, and it is just as well located for transportation and educational facilities as “A”-2. The houses on this small area are, for the most part, built on 100 foot lots which are priced from $2,500 to $3,500 at the present time.

Here is found various types of construction, such as frame, stucco, and brick, and while the average age of the houses throughout the area is perhaps 15 years, there is at the present time a great deal of new construction. The area is protected by deed restrictions calling for a $5,000 minimum cost of construction and excluding colored races. The area is almost 100% owner-occupied, and as far as could be determined, there is not a vacancy in it. It is very hard to establish a shrinkage trend over the depression years in this area because there was almost no change of ownership; even at the low point people living here were permanent residents and were able to hold their properties. There were likewise few transfers of building lots during the depression years, but on the basis of interviews with real estate men, it was thought that a 60-foot lot on Huntington Boulevard, which would have cost $2,000 in 1929, might have been purchased for $1,400 or $1,500 in 1933, and, now that there is renewed activity in the area, the lot would sell for $2,000 or more. Concerning the limited rental property in this neighborhood, a $50 rental in 1929 probably shrank to $35 and is now back to $50. Even a $150 rental only shrank to $100, and it is now renting for $150 again, because of the nature of Fresno, its being a rather small city where there is no rapid shifting of residential districts, the relation of the lot value to the improvements of an improved property varies a great deal. For example, a house was built on half a block on Huntington Avenue costing $30,000. The owner later built a $15,000 home on half of this large tract for his daughter. In a large metropolitan area, with its rapidly shifting residential districts, either the $30,000 house would be considered an over-improvement or the $15,000 house would be considered an under-improvement.

The area is about 90% owner-occupied, and there is almost no vacancy at present."}}}},"labelPositions":[{"id":"D5","point":[36.71785,-119.79990000000001]},{"id":"A1","point":[36.775803125,-119.80649062500002]},{"id":"A2","point":[36.762779687499986,-119.80323281249999]},{"id":"D8","point":[36.73411093749999,-119.73615468750003]},{"id":"B5","point":[36.7328078125,-119.76806718750001]},{"id":"C3","point":[36.78230644531251,-119.79669550781253]},{"id":"D1","point":[36.772787499999986,-119.79356249999998]},{"id":"C2","point":[36.756556249999996,-119.81336875]},{"id":"C4","point":[36.74950859375,-119.78579140624998]},{"id":"D2","point":[36.754203515624994,-119.768854296875]},{"id":"B1","point":[36.78390703125,-119.80239765625]},{"id":"C5","point":[36.755453906250004,-119.75891171875001]},{"id":"B3","point":[36.74465,-119.74535]},{"id":"C9","point":[36.739442187499996,-119.7472578125]},{"id":"B4","point":[36.739824999999996,-119.758425]},{"id":"D7","point":[36.73864930025312,-119.77409913798299]},{"id":"D9","point":[36.733855078125,-119.758116015625]},{"id":"C8","point":[36.7252828125,-119.76660781250003]},{"id":"D6","point":[36.73187265625,-119.78146015625]},{"id":"C6","point":[36.74849218749999,-119.8210921875]},{"id":"D3","point":[36.74844406568493,-119.82412336397218]},{"id":"D4","point":[36.7362712890625,-119.80715449218752]},{"id":"C7","point":[36.72602382812501,-119.807465234375]},{"id":"C1","point":[36.77772516513279,-119.79618356304172]},{"id":"B2","point":[36.770621093749995,-119.80158046874999]}]}
