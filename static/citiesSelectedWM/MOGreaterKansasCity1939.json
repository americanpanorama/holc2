Mr. Dible in his advertisements stresses the fact that his terms are \"less than FHA.\" These new houses can be acquired as low as $100 cash down payment, the balance at $55 per month. Mr. Dible's company, the Home Investment Corporation, takes a second mortgage after the buyer has obtained as large a first mortgage as possible from the savings and loan association or other institution. These terms have attracted a number of buyers to the area. Mr. Dible frankly stated that he would not now be building so many houses were it not for the fact that he was burdened with all the vacant land in this area and in order to \"come out\" he found it necessary to utilize the space.

Some houses are offered at no down payment, but amortized at larger monthly payments until the equivalent of a 10% down payment accrues.

The area has all utilities except sewers. Public utility transportation is inadequate. School children are trasnported by bus to nearby schools. Shawnee Mission High School is to the southwest about two miles. Taxes will run from $40 to $55 a year on the various properties.

The area has a thriving business district along High 50, all utilities except sewer and schools not far distant including the Shawnee Mission High School to the west. It is built up about 60%, with much building activity at present. Immediately south of 61st St. is \"Countryside\", a recently platted subdivision with six new houses in April 1839 of the larger and better type. This subdivision if it develops will undoubtedly be much better and more exclusive than Mission Hill Acres. The latter is a very spotted section with its wide range in variety and types of houses. The growth of this subdivision has been sufficient to warrant the establishment of a Post Office there, which was authorized in April 1939. While a good many FHA loans have been made in the area there are loans which are not FHA but made by the building and loan associations in Kansas City, Kansas and other points in Kansas, as well as the Federal savings and loan associations of Kansas City, Missouri. The Home Building & Loan Association of Ottowa, Kansas is quite active in this area.

The more expensive homes in the area have suffered a sharp drop in values during the last few years. \"For Sale\" signs are scattered throughout the district. A Jewish infiltration has injured the area from a standpoint of values. As a whole a very good second-grade area.

The area is restricted, has no business houses within it, but reasonably close to the community centers on Gregory at the south and at 63rd on the north.","9":{"1":"Kansas City, MO","2":"2","3":"B-15","4":"2/1/39"},"10":""}},"A10":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-94.5771,39.0116],[-94.5773,39.0087],[-94.578,39.0081],[-94.5782,39.0079],[-94.5794,39.0072],[-94.5795,39.007],[-94.5796,39.0038],[-94.5796,39.0016],[-94.5798,38.9998],[-94.5798,38.9996],[-94.5783,38.9984],[-94.5786,38.9918],[-94.5806,38.9918],[-94.585,38.9919],[-94.5846,38.9993],[-94.5845,39.0014],[-94.5845,39.0025],[-94.5845,39.0037],[-94.5843,39.0057],[-94.5842,39.0071],[-94.5841,39.0091],[-94.584,39.01],[-94.5841,39.0107],[-94.584,39.0119],[-94.5809,39.0118],[-94.5771,39.0116]]]]},"center":[39.002,-94.582],"boundingBox":[[38.992,-94.585],[39.012,-94.577]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"A","sqmi":0.428,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/MO/GreaterKansasCity/1939/full-size/A10.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/MO/GreaterKansasCity/1939/A10/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/MO/GreaterKansasCity/1939/A10/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/MO/GreaterKansasCity/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Above classes, few high income wage earners","d":"0%","c":{"2":""},"b":"Business, professional, executive ","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"100%","2":"","p":{"2":""},"o":{"2":""},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":""},"l":{"2":""},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":""}},"3":{"1":"35","2":"$7500-$10000","3":"Fair"},"4":{"b":"17, $118,000","a":"None"},"5":{"1":"2","b":"","a":"1, $5500"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"1938","2":"$37.70"},"8":"Between 65th and 69th, Oak to Holmes, in this area is J.C.

In Rockhill Gardens the Dible type of architecture, English-style bungalows, predominates.

After building up two blocks of attractive duplexes facing Meyer Boulevard it became apparent this type would not be popular and was discontinued. This entire area is the most active in Kansas City, Missouri as far as new building is concerned. As yet the area has only built up approximately 50%. As the area does not suffer from an excessive tax burden it will likely be popular for some time.

That portion west of Brookside Boulevard is a J.C. Nichols' development. Fletcher Cowherd and N.W. Diblo, prominent builders, engaged in rival activity between Brookside and Rockhill. Between these energetic and enterprising builders this area built up rapidly beginning twenty-five years ago. Except for the eastern fringe in the vicinity of Rockhill, it is distinctly a neighborhood of 2-story houses with some Queen Annes, a few bungalows, particularly in the south end and the east end. As a whole these structures were substantially built but the area is now declining. Between Brookside and Rockill, Morningside and 63rd, is Morningside Addition developed by Mr. Cowherd. This is an attractive, uniformly-built area of 2-story houses, largest in B-14. Although the area has retained some of its character, some of which is the distinction of being \"Country Club\", it has experienced sharp decline in values during the alst four years, in fact since 1929. Conversely, should there be a definite upturn in economic conditions locally, this area would undoubtedly display an upturn. The area has a high percentage of vacancies and hosues on the market for sale. Transportation facilities are inadequate in some parts of the area. There is an active business community at Brookside and 63rd, with the Plaza business district not far removed. The area is restricted, has all utilities, and adequate school facilities.

This is considered the best apartment dwelling neighborhood in Kansas City, there being something of distinction in living in the Plaza district.","9":{"1":"Kansas City, MO","2":"2","3":"B-10","4":"2/1/39"},"10":""}},"C31":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-94.5676,39.056],[-94.5681,39.0471],[-94.5682,39.045],[-94.5683,39.0421],[-94.5685,39.0415],[-94.5687,39.0411],[-94.5691,39.0404],[-94.5695,39.04],[-94.5699,39.0397],[-94.5705,39.0397],[-94.5712,39.0397],[-94.5716,39.0395],[-94.5722,39.0396],[-94.5726,39.0397],[-94.5726,39.0385],[-94.5742,39.038],[-94.5757,39.0382],[-94.5769,39.0383],[-94.578,39.0389],[-94.5787,39.039],[-94.5794,39.039],[-94.5801,39.0392],[-94.5811,39.0392],[-94.5828,39.0395],[-94.5835,39.0396],[-94.5853,39.0399],[-94.5854,39.0401],[-94.5857,39.0406],[-94.586,39.041],[-94.586,39.041],[-94.584,39.0411],[-94.5828,39.0412],[-94.5822,39.0415],[-94.5821,39.0416],[-94.5786,39.0414],[-94.5788,39.0422],[-94.5794,39.043],[-94.579,39.0432],[-94.5765,39.0433],[-94.5764,39.0434],[-94.574,39.0434],[-94.5739,39.0453],[-94.5746,39.0454],[-94.5774,39.0479],[-94.577,39.0563],[-94.5676,39.056]]]]},"center":[39.047,-94.573],"boundingBox":[[39.038,-94.586],[39.056,-94.568]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.622,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/MO/GreaterKansasCity/1939/full-size/C31.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/MO/GreaterKansasCity/1939/C31/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/MO/GreaterKansasCity/1939/C31/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/MO/GreaterKansasCity/1939/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"","d":"0","c":{"2":""},"b":"Wage-earners, Clerks","a":{"3":""}},"2":{"1":"95","2":"5","p":{"2":"Static"},"o":{"2":"Fair"},"n":{"5":""},"m":{"4":"Up 10%"},"l":{"2":"22.50-27.50"},"k":{"2":""},"j":{"2":""},"i":{"5":""},"h":{"4":""},"g":{"2":""},"f":{"2":""},"e":{"2":""},"d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":{"2":""},"a":{"2":"Apartments"}},"3":{"1":"0","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"63  $260,800","a":"32 App. Cap.

It is one of those once semi-exclusive neighborhoods which suffered severely from the trend to the Country Club district. Some large houses in the area can now be purchased for as low as $2750. Rents have held up slightly better than sales values. Mortgage money in the area is very limited.

Fifty years ago Quality Hill was an exclusive section occupied by some of the leading citizens. Its large two-story houses, mostly all brick, have long since been turned into 2-family structures and rooming houses. Typical of such an area they are in very poor repair. About 25% of the structures in the area are apartments varying in size from 4 and 6-family units to 24-units, with 3 or 4 40-unit structures. There is a definitie distinction in the type of property in Reservoir Hill and Quality Hill with West Pennway the dividing line. The south end is a slum section almost entirely of frame single-family houses, most of which have deteriorated to shaacks. This section is occupied by a low class of people, Mexicans and negroes predominating almost entirely. Mexicans are also scattered throughout the Quality Hill section where is also found a very poor type of people throughout including some negroes. There is no market for property in this area. It has the advantage of being close in but is unattractive to the better class of clerks and business sales people because of its surroundings and poor type of citizenry in the area generally. There are business encroachments throughout the area.

Scattered throughout the area are a large number of small factories and commercial institutions, such as laundries and similar service establishments. In this respect it sufers from the fact that the district was built up long before Kansas City had zoning restrictions. Throughout the area are a large number of apartments, particularly along 9th Street, The Paseo and other streets. Many of these are in the colored areas as well as other parts of the districts. There are a number of negro apartments renting at $25 a unit. Otherwise $20 per unit is the maximum.

At least 90% of the houses are frame, many of them cheap shacks probably constructed by the home owner in his spare time. The St. Clair section west of Tennessee is very cheap, built up 50% with small frame houses on hilly ground. These houses sell for $500 to $1000. The Mt. Washington and Sugar Creek sections as plotted are likewise on hilly and rolling ground, the homes a spotty variety most built as a utility with no regard for architectural planning. Many are cheap, some reasonably good, all housing industrial workers of the lower income brackets. The Englewood sextion between Highway 24 and the railroad at 17th, lies in rough territory with small cheap houses built throughout the rough area which is less than 50% built up, with unpaved streets and lacking many other conveniences. This section is cheaper than that in Mt. Washington and Sugar Creek. Hidden in this rolling terrain the houses are ill kept and neighborhoods unsightly. It is significant that throughout this entire area there are very few \"For Sale\" or \"For Rent\" signs. It is that type of an area where the cheap properties can be disposed of or rented to the laborers in the lower income brackets. A mixture of foreigners are found in northwest part of the area. A sewer is being laid into the Sinclair section in the northwest. ","9":{"1":"Inter-City Jackson County, Mo.
