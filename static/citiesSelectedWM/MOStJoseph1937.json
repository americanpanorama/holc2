The area is beautifully situated on Noyes Boulevard and Frederick Avenue. This was St. Joseph’s swank district, 20 years ago. Real estate men do not remember a sale in this area in the last 8 years. There is no demand whatever for the large, aging two-story structures. Furthermore, the occupants, following St. Joseph tradition, do not care to move from their well-established homes. There is no new exclusive area in St. Joseph to which this class of occupants would move.","15":{"1":"Mr. Barrow, Mr. Quinn, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Block","2":"8-11-37","3":""}}},"D5":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-94.8294,39.7771],[-94.8294,39.7758],[-94.8293,39.7755],[-94.829,39.7751],[-94.8287,39.7748],[-94.8287,39.7743],[-94.8294,39.7743],[-94.8302,39.7743],[-94.8301,39.7671],[-94.8313,39.7671],[-94.8313,39.766],[-94.8284,39.766],[-94.8285,39.765],[-94.8341,39.765],[-94.8341,39.7659],[-94.8378,39.7659],[-94.8378,39.7716],[-94.8397,39.7716],[-94.8401,39.7723],[-94.8329,39.7754],[-94.833,39.7765],[-94.833,39.777],[-94.832,39.777],[-94.8297,39.7771],[-94.8294,39.7771]]]]},"center":[39.771,-94.834],"boundingBox":[[39.765,-94.84],[39.777,-94.828]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sqmi":0.3,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/MO/StJoseph/1937/full-size/D5.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/MO/StJoseph/1937/D5/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/MO/StJoseph/1937/D5/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/MO/StJoseph/1937/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"1":"St. Joseph, Mo.","2":"D","3":"5"},"2":"Rolling to hillly","3":"Reasonably close in with a certain \"aristocracy\" which makes it desirable","4":"","5":{"g":{"2":""},"f":"6","e":"","d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":"1000-5000","a":"Business & professional men, executives, clerical workers"},"6":{"d":"Fair to good","c":"35","b":"Brick, frame","a":"1 and 2-story singles"},"7":{"1":"$2000-7000","2":"4000","3":"$35-75","4":"$45","5":"1932","6":"1500-3500","7":"2000","8":"50%","9":"25-40","10":"35","11":"70%","12":"Very few sales","13":"1500-4000","14":"2250","15":"55%","16":"25-40","17":"35","18":"70%","19":"1929","20":"","21":"1929","22":""},"8":{"c":"40","b":"98","a":"98"},"9":{"c":"Poor","b":"","a":"Poor"},"10":{"c":"Good","b":"Apts., 5-rm singles","a":"Good"},"11":{"b":"None","a":"None"},"12":{"b":"None","a":"Limited"},"13":"Downward","14":"This is an old section undoubtedly the best of the \"D\" areas from the standpoint of the desirability, security, type of occupants, and virtually every other angle.

This area was started in 1888 and grew to almost its present proportions 10 years later when the three packing plants (only two now) adjoining it made this one of the largest meat packing centers of the world at that time.  The area has suffered terribly from a real estate standpoint due to the slump in packing plant employment.  Sales are not made and rents are very definitely fixed at $20 to $22 a month for a small frame cottage.  There is not a $30-a-month house in the entire section.  There are many relief families in the area, including a good number for whom the Welfare Board pays $8 a month rent.","15":{"1":"Glen Brumbaugh, South St. Joseph banker, Mr. Smith, Mr. Block, Mr. Dittemore","2":"8-12-37","3":""}}},"C2":{"area_geojson_inverted":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[0,0],[0,90],[-180,90],[-180,0],[0,0]],[[-94.834,39.777],[-94.8358,39.7771],[-94.8358,39.7791],[-94.8359,39.7839],[-94.8339,39.7839],[-94.834,39.777]]]]},"center":[39.781,-94.835],"boundingBox":[[39.777,-94.836],[39.784,-94.834]],"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sqmi":0.047,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/MO/StJoseph/1937/full-size/C2.jpg","tileUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/MO/StJoseph/1937/C2/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","thumbnailUrl":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/MO/StJoseph/1937/C2/thumbnail.jpg","bucketPath":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/tiles/MO/StJoseph/1937/","sheets":1,"areaDesc":{"1":{"1":"St. Joseph, Mo.","2":"C","3":"2"},"2":"Rolling","3":"","4":"","5":{"g":{"2":""},"f":"Probably 6","e":"","d":{"2":""},"c":{"2":""},"b":"1000-1800","a":"Retired, clerical, some business and professional"},"6":{"d":"Fair","c":"30","b":"Frame, brick","a":"1&2- story"},"7":{"1":"$5000-7500","2":"$5,500","3":"$30-55","4":"$50","5":"1932","6":"3500-5500","7":"4000","8":"60%","9":"25-45","10":"37.5","11":"75%","12":"","13":"4000-6000","14":"4250","15":"65%","16":"25-45","17":"37.5","18":"75%","19":"1929","20":"","21":"1929","22":""},"8":{"c":"70","b":"99","a":"95"},"9":{"c":"1 sale in 1937","b":"","a":"Poor"},"10":{"c":"Good","b":"5-room singles","a":"Good"},"11":{"b":"1 house","a":"Brick cottage"},"12":{"b":"Ample","a":"Ample"},"13":"Downward","14":"This area lies alongside a hill which adds to its desirability as a section in which to live, but the large old houses have no sales demand.
