An old district of intermediate and mixed character along Central Park West is very good apartment territory, although there are still many old structures there. There has been a small settlement of negroes on 99th St. for many years, apparently not spreading. The district may gradually improve. Rentals for the most part are in medium brackets.

Included in the Multiple dwellings are a number of 2 and 3 family and store combinations along the avenues. Rents are from $5-15 per room depending on location and facilities as contrasted with approximately $7.50-22 in 1929. Sales values are nominal and low and vary depending upon size, typo, and location. Likewise there have been a certain number of conversions of former old single residences into small apartments numbering from 2-10 to a building. Those are in the same general rent ranges as the above. Many other former singles have been converted to roaming houses for operation as multiple dwellings. Leases on these are in quite good demand on a basis of around $100 per room per annum. This compares with a former high of $150 per room. Most of these houses contain from 12 to 15 rooms which are rented furnished for from $3.50 to $5 minimum to $10 maximum per week. These houses are saleable to a fair degree at prices ranging from $10,000-20,000 depending on size, condition and location. This represents about 50% depreciation from high prices.

Considerable revamping has taken place in last twenty years, quite a few modern apartment houses and substantial remodeling of old single homes into small apartments and rooming houses. Much of the area may continue a slow improvement. Certain of the streets in the area are much better than others. 12th St. between 6th & 7th Ave. still has some old private residences which are well kept up. Bank St. and West 10th and portions of others have witnessed remodeling on a good scale of old private residences into chiefly two and three room apartments. These converted dwellings may house from 3 to 10 families and command rentals up to $20 per room per month. This district had its geratest activity of recent years during the Prohibition Era. Many of its old or converted houses were partially occupied as speakeasies and commanded very high rents from such sources. Rents in the '20's whether for small apartments or furnished rooms were very high, probably on the average of more than twice the present levels. The poorer streets of the area are those where neither high grade remodeling has been done nor modern apartments erected and still represent very poor neighborhoods chiefly of cheap tenements renting for around $6-7 or $8 per room per month. Present price range (present market very limited) of private dwellings is primarily for conversion puposes and may be quoted on the better streets as about $12,000-20,000 as contrasted with former highs in the neighborhood of $20-40M. General upward trend. 4th St. is static. Wide range in sales and rental prices due to similar range in quality of various neighborhoods in the area.

This area is the southern-most portion of the East Side \"Slums\". It is inconceivable that it can get any worse. Structures in the main consists of 3-6 story tenements of great age and poorest type. A minor number are former single family structures, long since converted to rooming houses or small apartment use, and while listed as \"Miscellaneous\" are really in most cases \"Multi-dwellings\". There has been little if any change in either rental or price range of those latter for many years because they represent minimum cost housing. In earlier years the whole lower East SIde was a dumping ground for the hordes of immigrants entering the U.S. thru N.Y.C. In recent years, however, it has been losing population rapidly and demolition and boarding up have been substantial. Foreclosures have been heavy, and also, particularly in the last two years, acquisitions by mortgages thru surrendur of deeds.Recent enforcement of the provisions of the Multi-Dwelling Law, entailing in many cases prohibitive costs to comply therewith has accounted in a large degree for the latter. This is equally true as to demolition and boarding up. A large majority of all residential structures are \"old law\" (constructed prior to 1901) tenements and a substantial percentage of those still in use are 75 years or more of age. Majority of dwelling units in the multiple dwellings rent in the lowest brackets- under $25 per month and $30-35 is about the top. The square block, Cherry, Market, Monroe, Catherine Sts. is the site of Knickerbocker Village. This was intended to be a large slum clearance, low cost housing project, but its tenants are largely of a fairly good white collar class and top rents are $14-15 per room per month. Various groups are working to rehabilitate this area and in time may have material success thru concerted action in remodeling and replacement with modern low rent accomodations.

In 1929 some private homes could have been sold for as high as $100,000. This represwented fictitious prices and was far above value. Trend today is entirely to multi-family. Rents for private homes or rooming houses changed but little since 1929. No demand for such rentals in those times. Such rents were also indicative of excessive and fictitious selling prices.","6":{"1":"Carl Schurz Park, Manhattan","2":"B","3":"5"}}}}},"labelPositions":[{"id":"D4","point":[40.728887500000006,-74.00226249999999]},{"id":"D7","point":[40.732206250000004,-73.97960625]},{"id":"C4","point":[40.79866289062501,-73.96383710937499]},{"id":"D17","point":[40.771232421875006,-73.952955859375]},{"id":"D21","point":[40.79985,-73.95045000000002]},{"id":"B7","point":[40.80542578125001,-73.96180078124999]},{"id":"D10","point":[40.76591718749999,-73.98727656250001]},{"id":"D5","point":[40.744640234375005,-74.001826171875]},{"id":"D15","point":[40.761535156249984,-73.96313671875002]},{"id":"D24","point":[40.802332812500005,-73.9409890625]},{"id":"D16","point":[40.764884375,-73.955459375]},{"id":"A6","point":[40.776152734374996,-73.96207070312501]},{"id":"B3","point":[40.76390703125,-73.97707265624999]},{"id":"D22","point":[40.802228125000006,-73.955846875]},{"id":"D26","point":[40.815351608698684,-73.94469057515046]},{"id":"D23","point":[40.8052609375,-73.94799218749999]},{"id":"A3","point":[40.76584765625001,-73.96957421875001]},{"id":"A5","point":[40.771769531250015,-73.95998203125001]},{"id":"A4","point":[40.768471874999996,-73.962365625]},{"id":"D25","point":[40.79937421874999,-73.93509609374999]},{"id":"D27","point":[40.82612734375,-73.94029140625]},{"id":"C5","point":[40.82975078125,-73.94526796874999]},{"id":"B8","point":[40.82332265625,-73.95406640624999]},{"id":"B9","point":[40.84754062500001,-73.94213437500001]},{"id":"C6","point":[40.84522890625,-73.93482890624999]},{"id":"A8","point":[40.853901171875,-73.938234765625]},{"id":"D13","point":[40.773313281250005,-73.98533828125002]},{"id":"D18","point":[40.78171431242367,-73.9501376339773]},{"id":"B10","point":[40.85282109375001,-73.92994609375]},{"id":"B11","point":[40.866748046874996,-73.921845703125]},{"id":"B12","point":[40.87621171875,-73.91069140625001]},{"id":"D19","point":[40.79484921875,-73.93876328125002]},{"id":"D20","point":[40.79265507812501,-73.948252734375]},{"id":"B6","point":[40.798345703125,-73.971835546875]},{"id":"C3","point":[40.791282031250006,-73.97067734374998]},{"id":"B4","point":[40.78338749999999,-73.97846250000003]},{"id":"D14","point":[40.7752125,-73.98003750000001]},{"id":"C1","point":[40.736639453125015,-74.00236523437502]},{"id":"B1","point":[40.73320703124999,-73.99555546875001]},{"id":"A7","point":[40.78395078125001,-73.95636796875]},{"id":"D1","point":[40.714814453125,-73.988284765625]},{"id":"D2","point":[40.72009531250001,-73.99397656250001]},{"id":"D3","point":[40.72579921875,-73.98341328125]},{"id":"D6","point":[40.735015624999996,-73.982946875]},{"id":"C2","point":[40.736346874999995,-73.986771875]},{"id":"D9","point":[40.7443078125,-73.9809734375]},{"id":"D8","point":[40.74026796875,-73.97953671875]},{"id":"B2","point":[40.748379687500005,-73.97963593749999]},{"id":"D11","point":[40.747100781250005,-73.97461796875]},{"id":"D12","point":[40.752838671875,-73.970526953125]},{"id":"A1","point":[40.756682812499996,-73.96237031249998]},{"id":"A2","point":[40.756907031249995,-73.97352734374998]},{"id":"B5","point":[40.77630546874999,-73.94392734375]}]}
