The University of Kansas City is to the north and immediately to the east are a number of multi-family structures, large in size and declining rapidly in value.

At the end of January 1939, 22 of the 46 houses had been sold. They are a variety of brick, stone and frame bungalows, 1 1/2 and 2-story structures selling from $4500 to $7200, the big majority at about $6000. It is a \"high pressure area\" as to sales promotion situated in a rural neighborhood, surrounded by farms, with a cheaper resdiential section adjoining on the west. Sales are made to wage carners, minor executives and small business men, some of whome borrow on life insurance policies to make the 10% down payment. Some houses are offered at no down payment, but amortized at larger monthly payments until the equivalent of a 10% down payment accrues. It is graded \"A\" because it is now, restricted, not entirely built up. The construction is not as substantial as that in other newer sections, including Country Club. The area has all utilities except sewers. Public utility transportation is inadequate. School children are trasnported by bus to nearby schools. Shawnee Mission High School is to the southwest about two miles. Taxes will run from $40 to $55 a year on the various properties. Application was made in January for another blanket loan to finance 34 houses of teh same type and size to be built in 1939.

The growth of this subdivision has been sufficient to warrant the establishment of a Post Office there, which was authorized in April 1939.

Between these energetic and enterprising builders this area built up rapidly beginning twenty-five years ago.

This is an attractive, uniformly-built area of 2-story houses, largest in B-14. Although the area has retained some of its character, some of which is the distinction of being \"Country Club\", it has experienced sharp decline in values during the alst four years, in fact since 1929. Conversely, should there be a definite upturn in economic conditions locally, this area would undoubtedly display an upturn. The area has a high percentage of vacancies and hosues on the market for sale. Transportation facilities are inadequate in some parts of the area. There is an active business community at Brookside and 63rd, with the Plaza business district not far removed. The area is restricted, has all utilities, and adequate school facilities.

The area has suffered a severe shrinkage in values, there being very little demand for the large houses upon which the assessed valuation in many cases is twice the fair market value. In the vicinity of Manheim Road is a Jewish district into which moved the leading Jews some thirty years ago. Armour Boulevard in this area has many of the city's largest apartments. Between Oak and Main, 43rd and Armour, are also many apartments. Much of the area is going into rooming houses. the section south of 43rd is restricted only to residential uses, therefore cannot turn to rooming houses which is a detriment to that neighborhood.

The area has retained an orderly appearance but is due to decline rapidly because of its location surrounded by old and poor property, also commercial encroachments. It is also going to rooming houses. The spacious garage and parking lot of the Public Service Company (for buses) is at the north. Assessed valuation is above market value in this area.

Its large two-story houses, mostly all brick, have long since been turned into 2-family structures and rooming houses. Typical of such an area they are in very poor repair.

There is a definitie distinction in the type of property in Reservoir Hill and Quality Hill with West Pennway the dividing line. The south end is a slum section almost entirely of frame single-family houses, most of which have deteriorated to shaacks. This section is occupied by a low class of people, Mexicans and negroes predominating almost entirely. Mexicans are also scattered throughout the Quality Hill section where is also found a very poor type of people throughout including some negroes. There is no market for property in this area. It has the advantage of being close in but is unattractive to the better class of clerks and business sales people because of its surroundings and poor type of citizenry in the area generally.

A few large hosues were built on Gladstone overlooking the northeast industrial distrct ten years ago. Older houses which cost up to $75,000 can now be acquired for less than $7000. The area has suffered because of a heavy Italian encroachment and is now attractive only to wage earners. There are a number of apartments scattered throughout the area, particularly in the west end. Although newer, the houses in the area are of smaller type than those in D-30. It is a spotty section where mortgage money is available on a limited basis.
