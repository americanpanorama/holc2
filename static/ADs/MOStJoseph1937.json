It is entirely a laboring man's area.  Houses from 12th Street to the railroad tracks are very poor type of shacks, housing relief families, low wage earners.  East of 12th Street and in the southern part of the area are a better class of occupants and better class of property.  There have been a few sales in the better type of houses.","15":{"1":"Mr. Quinn, Mr. Dittemore, Mr. Block","2":"8-12-37","3":""}}},"C8":{"ad_id":87,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/MO/St.Joseph/1937/","areaDesc":{"1":{"1":"St. Joseph, Mo.","2":"C","3":"8"},"2":"Level to rolling","3":"Adjoins Bartlett Park, not far from golf course","4":"No outstanding ones","5":{"g":{"1":"","2":""},"f":"10","e":"","d":{"1":"None","2":""},"c":{"1":"None","2":""},"b":"1200-3000","a":"Clerical, business, professional"},"6":{"d":"Fair to good","c":"30","b":"Frame, brick","a":"1 & 2 story"},"7":{"1":"$4500-10,000","2":"6000","3":"$35-50","4":"$40","5":"1932","6":"3500-5,000","7":"4000","8":"60%","9":"20-35","10":"27.5","11":"","12":"","13":"4000-5,000","14":"4200","15":"60%","16":"20-35","17":"27.5","18":"","19":"1929","20":"","21":"1929","22":""},"8":{"c":"","b":"96","a":""},"9":{"c":"Poor","b":"","a":"Poor"},"10":{"c":"Good","b":"","a":"Good"},"11":{"b":"1 or 2","a":"None"},"12":{"b":"Ample","a":"Ample"},"13":"Downward","14":"An area with the typical St. Joseph variety of all sizes and types of houses, from 10 to 50 years old.
