With the exception of Fletcher Park, properties in this Section range from 1 to 15 years old and are in fair condition, needing only minor repairs.  Properties in Fletcher Park, however, were built during the World War by the Federal Government for shipyard workers and a superior grade of construction was utilized even though all of the properties are uniform and have no architectural individuality; due to this superior construction, the properties in Fletcher Park today are in good condition and need no repairs.  The principal detrimental influences of the entire Section are the Section's proximity to the Florida East Coast Railroad, proximity to lumber yards, and congestion of vehicular traffic during rush hours over St. Johns bridge.  The beneficial influences are the good schools, parks, playgrounds, and the Section's accessibility to the beaches; furthermore, the Section is about 3 miles from the center of the City and is almost entirely surrounded by water, thus equalizing the climatic conditions of the Section.
