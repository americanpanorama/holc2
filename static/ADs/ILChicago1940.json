This section is also feeling an Italian infiltration, which is slightly more marked than in the territory north of Division St. Many of the better class occupants from this territory have already moved westward to Oak Park. The so-called \"Austin reputation\" favorably effects this district, and properties here will bring 10 to 15 per cent more than similar properties in other territories. Generally speaking, these properties are very well held and few came into the market through foreclosure during recent years. In addition to the prices quoted above on housing units, there is a fair number of small frame cottages valued as low as $4,000, which rent for $35.00 per month. There is also scattered through the section a few three family units valued at $11,000 to $12,000, whose rents are comparable to those quoted above on two family structures which are for heated units. Several of the corners are built with large apartments which rent from $9.00 to $11.00 per room. Obsolescence is a very noticeable factor, particularly in the larger two story residences.

The area is at least 45 or 50 years old, and is strictly a residential one of a conglomerated mixture of almost every conceivable type of home. Occupied by people of very moderate means with an average income of those employed of $1,500 per year. There are no manufacturing industries and during the depression many people were on relief in this section. It is one of the sections of Chicago where there are no building restricttinos against framehomes. During the last few years sewers and pavement have been put in by public funds. This absorbed many laborers living on relief, and has been the means of improving the section with some new frame construction of inferior type. The trend of this new building is between Kedzie Avenue and the Ridge Country Golf Club between 103rd and 108th where about two dozen new 1 1/2 and 2 story frames have been built of cheap construction. At 108th there are a few scattered new homes among the very old ones, all very inferior. North of 111th, west of Homan for a few blocks are about 24 new frame homes scattered throughout the area as far north as 108th, nearly all 1 and 1 1/2 frame, on all sizes of lots, and (over) different types of construction; throughout the entire area there are only a few moderate brick homes. There is a new public school recently constructed on the east side of Homan and between 108th and 109th. On 108th east of Homan and west of Kedzie is much vacant property. South of 115th on Homan is a somewhat better grade of home of mixed frame construction. South of 111th on Kedzie, an old part of the area, are some very old homes without basements built on posts.

Halsted Street, a main thoroughfare running north and sotuh, with much vacant land for one-half block on either side, has recently had installed a large sewer built from public funds. East of Halsted is a section known as the Fernwood District. Transportation in this area has not been good, but recently a new bus line has been opened on Halsted Street, and also on 95th Street at the north, and since this has occurred, there has been more interest taken in this area. Present indications are that it will develop slowly. There have been no assessments for some years, but there are many unpaid from former years. North of 99th Street the area is quite sparsely settled. East of Vincennes is approximately one-half restricted to Whites, and property lying east of Vincennes Avenue is somewhat more difficult to move than that lying on the west. Practically all homes on Halsted north from 103rd Street are frame. On Peoria between 96th and 99th Streets are a number of brick bungalows; continuing south of 101st Street frames predominate (over) and south of 102nd Street bricks predominate again. On Sangamon, north of 103rd, are many brick singles. There is much vacant property between 101st and 100th Streets. Lots are mostly 25 foot. Development of this area should be somewhat better from now on due to improved transportation and the fact that the large sewer on Halsted Street is now in. The district is comparatively new and it is likely to develop into a moderate priced area of homes not exceeding $7,500, as the neighborhood does not justify anything better. The trend of growth is to the east. Halsted Street is zoned for business.","9":{"1":"Washington Heights","2":"C","3":"September 11, 1900","4":"October 25, 1939"}}},"D4":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D4/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"","d":"","c":{"1":"","2":""},"b":"Low middle class- laborers- mechanics","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"","2":"","p":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"o":{"1":"Good","2":""},"n":{"1":"(1939-Oct.) $25.00-40.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"$25.00-40.00","2":"13+","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"$22.50-35.00","2":""},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"j":{"1":"Poor to fair","2":""},"i":{"2":"(1939-Oct.) $3,000-5,000","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$3,000-5,000","2":"7+","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"$3,000-4,500","2":""},"f":{"1":"65%","2":""},"e":{"1":"98%","2":""},"d":{"1":"Poor","2":""},"c":{"1":"35 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Frame","2":""},"a":{"1":"One-family; 5-6 rooms","2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"December 31, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 1, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"A poor area of old houses housing many street railway employees from the car yards directly adjacent on the north.

A number of families formerly living in this district have moved to newer areas in Winnetka, and there are a number of properties for sale by individual owners, but they are generally considered to be priced well above present market value. They are therefore not selling. The district has a good community spirit and is further favorably affected by its nearness to New Trier Township High Schoool at the southern end of the district. Warwick nad Abbotsford classes are in the Kenilworth school district, which is particularly favorable because classes are generally very small.

Schools are also very good and transportation available by commuter tarin, North Shore Electric, as well as elevated which ends at Third and Linden. Properties along Sheridan Road are somewhat better than those on the other streets, but they are less desirable because of the heavy traffic flow along Sheridan Road, particularly on Sunday. Properties in east Wilmette carry a certain social advantage and this reputation is traded upon whenever properties are sold. Pride of ownership is very apparent, most properties being well shrubbed. The streets are lined with beautiful, large, shade trees. Vacancy is virtually nill, and becausae of this heavy occupancy there is some indication that an upward adjustment in rents may be affected during 1940. The price bracket above includes the majority of the structures, but there are a number of estate properties valued well above $20,000. Mortgage financing is limited to $16,000 as a matter of policy by most major lenders. This is not meant to indicate that (over) financing is not available in the district. Properties along the south side of Lake Ave. west of Sheridan Road are very good. Altho it might be said that many of the structures in this territoty are somewhat obsolete, considerable reconditioning and remodeling is continually taking place, and the section is certainly considered to be \"holding its own\", at the present time. The northern tip of this area is somewhat adversely affected by the proximity to a section called \"No Man's Land\", which has recently been annexed to the village of Wilmette. The legallity of this annexatino is now being contested in the courts, but irrespective of the outcome, the adverse influence will probably continue altho is will be necessarily minimized should the village gain control, as they will probably eliminate all small business and possibly close the beach to other than local residents. The new construction has been a recent subdivision of a piece of vacant ground lying along the railroad at the end of the extension of Ashland and Greenwood Aves. This was a speculative development, and more favorably located should warrant a \"A\" classification, but because of its proximity to the railroad it is rated as \"B\". This small section is not coming into hands quite as strong as the property in the rest of the areas.","9":{"1":"Wilmette, Ill.","2":"2nd","3":"B-27","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"A24":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"A","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/A24/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"1":"0%","2":""},"b":"Upper middle class & upper class","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"100%","2":"","p":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"o":{"1":"Good- $150.00-200.00","2":""},"n":{"1":"$150.00-250.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"$150.00-250.00","2":"11+","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"$135.00-225.00","2":""},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"j":{"1":"Good- $25,000-30,000","2":""},"g":{"1":"$22,500-35,000","2":""},"f":{"1":"85%","2":""},"e":{"1":"99-100%","2":""},"d":{"1":"Good","2":""},"c":{"1":"5-20 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Brick","2":""},"a":{"1":"One family 8-12 rooms","2":""},"i":{"2":"$25,000-40,000","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$25,000-40,000","2":"13+","3":"","4":""}},"3":{"1":"January 2, 1900","2":"one family","3":"owner built"},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Ample $16,000","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a very high grade area of considerable social standing and good class improvement.

There is not a vacant house in the territory, and occupancy, moreover, is about 150 per cent, for most houses have more than one family living in them. Sales have been very good where liberal financing terms are available, but on other sales mortgage financing is virtually impossible to obtain. This concentration of negroes in Evanston is quite a serious problem for the town as they seem to be growing steadily and encroaching into adjoining neighborhoods. The two family structures are in most cases converted singles and they likewise are overflowing with occupants; these buildings are rented as unheated units. The number of persons on relief in this district is probably heavier than in any other area long the north shore.

Proximity to Lake Michigan is favorable, but there are practically no riparian properties except between Kedzie and Keeney, and between Lee and Main on Edgemere Road. These two short blocks because of their riparian rights warrant a first class rating, but are included in this area because of their small size. Houses on Edgemere are particularly outstanding and their age is only about 12 years. The lake front, except as noted above, is all park district with many bathing beaches along its entire length. Each year a separate bathing beach is designated for the large colored population living in Evanston, the thought being a constant shifting of this locatino would minimize the adverse affect of negro bathing facilities. Living in the area are some of Evanston's fine, old wealth families, and in spite of the age of the structures, the neighborhood continues as one of the most desirable along the shore. Schools and churches are particularly good and transportation is available by either elevated or commuter train. Main Street (over) and Davis St. are the main shopping centers. Rentals on these larger houses have remained unchanged in recent years but vacancy has decreased. In a few cases some of the large houses have nothing more than caretaker occupancy at nominal rents. The neighborhood is graded \"B\" because of the age of the buildings, but could almost warrant a more favorable rating from the standpoint of class of occupancy and Lake Michigan location. The new construction is located on Forest Ave. at Burnham Place. This site is a former estate which has been broken up for subdividing purposes. The houses were built to individual specifications. Further development of this character may be anticipated, but it is rather doubtful that it will be of very large proportions.

The bulk of the one family structures are of substantial age, and altho fairly readily sold, other second class areas in Evanston and along the north shore are in greater demand. This neighborhood is very well located and is particuarly convenient to both elevated and commuter train transportation, the latter stopping at Main St. there are about six houses on Dempster, between Judson and Forest Aves., which are and have been for a number of years, occupied by negroes. Their location in this vicinity adversely affects the adjoining properties, but it is very doubtful that they will ever spread any further than they already are. The bulk of the property in this section is very well held, and has many occupants of long standing in their present structures. Apartment buildings are concentrated on Hinman, south of Lee St. and on Michigan, Sheridan, and Sheridan Square, south of Keeney. These structures came into the area prior to 1929 and are generally speaking, first class apartments renting for an average of $20.00 per room. The residential structures on these (over) three streets are older than the bulk of the properties in the area as a whole, and should be graded no better than third class, primarily because they are noticeably obsolete. Their value is only slightly above the value of the ground, and it is generally believed that when apartment house construction again gets under way, many of these units will be razed and the ground improved with apartments similar to those already here. Rents quotes above on two and three family structures are for heated units. The higher priced two and three structures are for heated units. The higher priced two and three family structures are in most cases deluxe buildings. One family units in the balance of the territory range from good to mediocre, but because of the favorable reputation of East Evanston, the neighborhood is graded as second grade, but rated as minus becaues its future seems somewhat unassured. There is a good shopping center on Main St. and a first class shopping center around the intersection of Sherman and Davis. There is little possibility of this neighborhood being adversely affected in the near future, by an infiltration of a class other than that which occupies the neighborhood today. Hinman is the least desirable street because of heavy traffic, and because west side backs up to business on Chicago Ave. Asssessed values are high.","9":{"1":"Evanston, Ill.","2":"Low 2nd","3":"B-42","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"C29":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/C29/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"1":"0%","2":""},"b":"Lower middle class","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"100%","2":"","p":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"o":{"1":"Good","2":""},"n":{"1":"$40.00-50.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"$40.00-50.00","2":"12+","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"$35.00-45.00","2":""},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"j":{"1":"Poor","2":""},"i":{"2":"$6,000-7,500","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$6,000-7,500","2":"December 30, 1899","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"$6,000-7,500","2":""},"f":{"1":"70%","2":""},"e":{"1":"100%","2":""},"d":{"1":"Fair to poor","2":""},"c":{"1":"25-35 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Frame- stucco","2":""},"a":{"1":"One family 5-7 rooms","2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This small section along South Boulevard and the lower end of Chicago Ave. has a preponderance of mediocre and dilapidated housing.

Along Pratt Street, fronting on the Golf course, are the best one-family houses, which are valued between $16,000 and $30,000. They are, however, not typical of this section. The more expensive rentals quoted above for three-family units are semi-deluxe buildings where apartments have two baths. The more favorable increase in prices indicated on three-family units between 1935 and 1936 is occasioned by the seriously depressed values on this class of property during most of the depression. There is a possibility that the Edgewater Golf Club may eventually be sub-divided and at present it is assessed for $10,000 per acre which would mean that any development would be equally high grade.

The three-family units, however, are largely concentrated primarily west of California and constitute about 25 per cent of the structures, valued $12,000-14,000 and renting for $60 to $75. These units show a slight weakness in price structure because of the inclination of institutional holders to force these properties into the market. The somewhat unfavorable experience in prices on one-family houses is occasioned by the competition of new construction occurring in this area, and in the area immediately to the north and northwest. Although only a minimum of new construction is occurring in this section, it is of a lower grade than that that is already here. It is anticipated that further construction will continue but it will be in a price range between $7,000 and $8,500. The prices quoted above on all classes of units (over) are expected to remain relatively firm during the next six to twelve months. The general reputation of the section is good. Shopping centers and schools west of California are somewhat inconvenient but improvements throughout the area are comparatively uniform. There is a sizeable number of deluxe three-family units valued in today's market between $15,000 and $19,000 renting between $80.00 and $95.00 per unit. Larger apartments constitute about 20 per cent of the buildings and rent for $10.00 to $12.00 per room. Prices on two-family units have remained relatively stable primarily because these buildings are so well held. Although there are a few Jewish families in this neighborhood, no marked infiltration is noticeable at the present time, and the section should remain fairly stable during the next three to five years.","9":{"1":"Rogers Park","2":"2nd","3":"B-73","4":"Oct. 1939"}}},"B77":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/B77/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Jewish from Albany Park","d":"0%","c":{"1":"3%","2":"Jewish"},"b":"","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"35%","2":"25%","p":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"o":{"1":"Good- up to $60.00","2":"Good- up to $50.00"},"n":{"1":"(1939-Oct.) $52.50-67.50","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"(1939-Oct.) $45.00-55.00","5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"1":"$52.50-67.50","2":"11+","3":"$45.00-55.00","4":"11+"},"l":{"1":"$47.50-60.00","2":"$40.00-50.00"},"k":{"1":"Slightly weak","2":"Slightly weak"},"j":{"1":"Fair- up to $12,500","2":"Fair- up to $7,500"},"i":{"2":"(1939-Oct.) $11,000-13,000","3":"9-","4":"(1939-Oct.) $5,500-10,000","5":"9-"},"h":{"1":"$12,000-14,500","2":"10+","3":"$6,000-11,000","4":"13+"},"g":{"1":"$11,000-13,000","2":"$5,500-9,500"},"f":{"1":"40%","2":"60%"},"e":{"1":"97-98%","2":"99-100%"},"d":{"1":"Good","2":"Good"},"c":{"1":"12-13 years","2":"17-18 years"},"b":{"1":"Brick","2":"Brick- stucco"},"a":{"1":"Three-family; 5-6 rooms","2":"One-family; 5-6 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"December 30, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 5, 1900"},"6":"FHA 80%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This are is similar in many respects to the section directly north of Devon, but a marked infiltration of Jewish has adversely affected values since 19937. There is a slight weakness in the price structure at the persent site, although rents remain firm. The construction of a synagogue in the area has indicated that the are may eventually become known as a Jewish section. In addition to the prices quoted on three-family units, there are a fair number of deluxe three-family units in the area valued between $16,000 and $19,000 which rent between $85 and $100. About 20 per cent of the structure in the area are larger apartments renting for $10 to $12 a room. Because of the market infiltration, a slight weakness in the price structure and the anticipated down trend, it is recommended that an orderly but quick liquidation be followed in this neighborhood. Area is graded \"B\" because of improvements and appearance, but penalized because of changing occupancy. About 20 per cent of the structures are two-family units valued from $8,500 to $11,000; renting $50-65; prices on these properties are also somewhat weak.","9":{"1":"Rogers Park","2":"Low 2nd","3":"B-77","4":"Oct. 1939"}}},"B63":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/B63/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Jewish, north of Peterson","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"Scandinavian-German"},"b":"Middle class","a":{"1":"Slowly","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899","p":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"o":{"1":"Good- up to $55.00","2":"Good- up to $50.00"},"n":{"1":"(1939-Sept.) $47.50-60.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"(1939-Sept.) $40.00-65.00","5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"1":"$47.50-60.00","2":"20+","3":"$40.00-65.00","4":"12+"},"l":{"1":"$40.00-50.00","2":"$35.00-55.00"},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"j":{"1":"Fairly good- up to $8,500","2":"Fairly good- up to $7,500"},"i":{"2":"(1939-Sept.) $8,000-10,000","3":"7-","4":"(1939-Sept.) $6,000-9,500","5":"6-"},"f":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"e":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"d":{"1":"Good","2":"Good"},"c":{"1":"12-15 years","2":"12-15 years"},"b":{"1":"Brick","2":"Brick- few stone"},"a":{"1":"Two-family; 5-6 rooms","2":"One-family; 6-7 rooms"},"h":{"1":"$8,500-10,750","2":"17+","3":"$6,500-10,000","4":"12+"},"g":{"1":"$7,500-9,000","2":"$5,750-9,000"}},"3":{"1":"January 3, 1900","2":"One-family","3":"Owner built"},"4":{"b":"50 units","a":"January 9, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"January 19, 1900","a":"January 9, 1900"},"6":"Ample","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This neighborhood of two-family houses is inconvenient to good transportation, but properties are of good character and well maintained.

The area is about 90 per cent built and some speculative building is occurring on those scattered lots which, in most cases, are 25 and 30 foot size, as are the bulk of the lots in the territory.

Area in its present development may be said to be slowly declining in desirability, but building activity in neighboring areas may spread to this district with any volume of additional building, and when the vacant ground directly to the south starts to develop, it is thought that this section may be favorably affected.","9":{"1":"Elmwood Park, Ill.","2":"3rd","3":"C-97","4":""}}},"D6":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D6/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"1":"50%","2":"Italian- Polish"},"b":"Lower class- labor- \"reliefers\"","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"100%","2":"","p":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"o":{"1":"Good- $25.00","2":""},"n":{"1":"(1939-Dec.) $18.00-252.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"$18.00-25.00","2":"14+","3":"","4":""},"j":{"1":"Fair to poor","2":""},"i":{"2":"(1939-Dec.) $2,500-4,000","3":"5+","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$2,500-4,000","2":"11+","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"$2,250-3,600","2":""},"f":{"1":"80%","2":""},"e":{"1":"99-100%","2":""},"d":{"1":"Poor to fair","2":""},"c":{"1":"20-25 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Frame- few brick","2":""},"a":{"1":"Cottages- 3-5 rooms","2":""},"l":{"1":"$16.00-22.50","2":""},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 2, 1900"},"6":"Very limited","7":{"1":"April 22, 1905","2":"$6.62 on 37% assessed value"},"8":"N/A","9":{"1":"Elmwood Park, Ill.","2":"4th","3":"D-6","4":""}}},"A31":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"A","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/A31/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Desirable Class","d":"0%","c":{"1":"0%","2":""},"b":"Middle class- some better","a":{"1":"Steadily","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"100%","2":"","p":{"1":"","2":""},"o":{"1":"","2":""},"n":{"1":"Area","3":"","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"Rental","2":"","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"Not a","2":""},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"j":{"1":"Good","2":""},"i":{"2":"(1939 Dec.) $6,500-9,500","3":"","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"","2":"","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"","2":""},"f":{"1":"100%","2":""},"e":{"1":"100%","2":""},"d":{"1":"Good","2":""},"c":{"1":"New to 3 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Brick- few frame","2":""},"a":{"1":"One family- 6-8 rooms","2":""}},"3":{"1":"February 8, 1900","2":"one family $6,500-9,500","3":"Fairly good"},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"December 31, 1899"},"6":"FHA","7":{"1":"April 22, 1905","2":"6.62 on 37% assessed value"},"8":"This area is less than 10 per cent developed with the bulk of the structures concentrated near North Ave. The neighborhood is improving as additional building take places and the adjoining vacant ground on the east may take its character fro this section.

One negro family resides in the area, but there is no possibility whatever of any further infiltration. Catholic influence is strongly felt due to a fine, large church and parcochial school; and the majority of property owners between Oak Park and Ridgeland Aves. are Catholic and what demand there is due to (over) proximity of religious and educational facilities.

There are 1-family frame units; 1-family brick units; 2 and 3-family units; 4-family structures; small apartments; large apartments; and scattered business. The eastern part of the section is already blighted and the blight is extending westward, although it has not yet overtaken the northwest corner west of Damen and north nof Division; this latter portion is the best part of this district. In addition to the prices quoted above, about 5 per cent of the structures are 4-family units, selling between $3,000 and $4,000. Most lots are 25 feet or less, with houses built very close together, most of them immediately adjacent to the sidewalk. Population is largely lower class Polish, but there is a marked infiltration of Italian from the district to the south, and the future of the area appears even less secure than it is today. The new subway, which is under construction at the present time, will run out Milwaukee Ave. and reduce (over) the transportation time to the loop to approximately five minutes, whereas, it is now about twenty. This may have a favorable effect on property values, but it is most doubtful that it will ever be of sufficient importance to favorably affect trend of desirability in the neighborhood or attract a better class population. Milwaukee Ave. is a commercial street throughout its entire length, and, as such, is considered a fair business section. The best local shopping center is on Chicago Avenue, between Ashland and Damen. Because of its mixed character and the disrepair of most properties, the district is most unattractive to other than lower-income groups and it is, therefore, graded fourth class, with the further comment that it will be even poorer during the coming years. It is somewhat questionable whether this would be an advisable place for a slum clearance project.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"4th","3":"D-29","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"D9":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D9/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"1":"40%","2":"Polish, German, Scandinavian"},"b":"Lower class","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"45%","2":"45%","p":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"o":{"1":"$20.00- fair","2":"$20.00- fair"},"n":{"1":"(1939) $17.50-25.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"(1939) $17.50-25.00","5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"1":"$17.50-25.00","2":"10+","3":"$17.50-25.00","4":"10+"},"l":{"1":"$16.00-22.50","2":"$16.00-22.50"},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"j":{"1":"$2,500-good","2":"$3,500- good"},"i":{"2":"(1939) $2,000-3,500","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"(1939) $2,500-4,500","5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"1":"$2,000-3,500","2":"December 30, 1899","3":"$2,500-4,500","4":"December 30, 1899"},"g":{"1":"$2,000-3,500","2":"$2,500-4,500"},"f":{"1":"50%","2":"40%"},"b":{"1":"Frame 2/3; brick 1/3","2":"Frame & brick"},"a":{"1":"1-family; 6 rooms & 4 rm.

Three story brick apartmens are numerous along Central Ave. and Washington Blvd., as well as on corner lots in the less important streets near the south end.

However, the nearest first class shopping district is in Oak Park about 3 miles west, and is accessible via Lake St. elevated. This area was originally settled by Scandinavian railroad workers for the North Western Railroad yards, many of whome still reside here. In recent years a few Italian and Greek families have trickled in, but there has been no marked infiltration. Toward the eastern end are many small cheap frame cottages. The quality of housing improves westward and there is a scattering of brick, two family structures near the west end. Nearly all of the small, cheap cottages are occupied by owners and the rental range does not include this type of housing. There are pretty fair quality two flats grouped along Leamington and LeClaire in the first two blocks north of Lake St. The mortgage (over) aspecct in this area is not particularly good, 50% of the appraisal being about the best proposition offered by the few institutions willing to lend here.

As a whole the area would probably be 20-25% Jewish. Some of this migration is coming from Lawndale and from the southwest side of Chicago. Land values are quite high due to the fact that the area is zoned for apartment buildings. This penalizes single family occupancy because of high taxes based on exclusive land values, which are from $60-80 a front foot, altho one authority estimates them at $100 a front foot. An example of this is shown where HOLC had a house on Mason St. exposed for sale over a (over) period of two years at prices beginning at $6,000 and going down to $4,500. it was finally sold for $3,800. The land alone is taxed based on a valuation exceeding that amount. This area is favored by good transportation and by proximity to a good Catholic Church and parochial school. There are a few scattered two flats in which units rent for about $55. Columbus Park on the south affords exceptional recreational advantages. The Hawthorne Building & Loan, Bell Savings Building & Loan, and Prairie State Bank have loaned in this area, without the FHA insurance provision.

Between Washington and Madison St. is zoned for apartment buildings and any conversions from singles are readily permitted. Taxes are somewhat high due to zoning, which however, has been helpful in securing loans incidental to the sale of old properties. There are many apartment buildings along Washington, Randoph, Pleasant, Maple and Wisconsin Aves.; also Oak Park and Kenilworth. Institutions are shy of this area and have continually reduced prices on their large, old, foreclosed houses.

Shopping facilities are only mediocre, and many residents avail themselves of the excellent shopping centers in Oak Park about 3 miles south. Shortly after the development of Franklin Park many lots were sold to outsiders seeking speculative possibilities. Following hte panic of 1894, the developers took back a large number of these lots and (over) sicne then taxes have piled up, as well as general and special assessments, so that development has been retarded as a result.

A large cemetery is at the southwest corner of the town, which however does not appear to be regarded as an adverse influence by the type of residents living in Schiller Park. The best quality of constructino in the village is found directly opposite the cemetery on Irving Park Blvd., where there are a few modern brick bungalows in good condition. The balance of the residential area is indicative of rather poor maintenance, and not mcuh pride of ownership. There are few sidewalks and not many paved streets aside form the one or two principal highways. Just outside the village limits at the west on Irving Park Blvd. two new houses have been built in what promises to be a very pooor development; no paved streets, no sidewalks, entirely treeless and rather bizarre type of (over) architecture. There is a grammar school in the village, but no high school, and shopping facilities are poor. Lack of transportation facilities would repel any influx of population from outside who did not find employment in the nearby railroad shops or yards. Schiller Park is, in short, a railroad town and the inhabitants are nearly all wage earners in the low brackets. Low grade population, poor development, and appearance, indicate a third class.","9":{"1":"Schiller Park, Ill.","2":"3rd","3":"C-90","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"D16":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D16/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"1":"0%","2":""},"b":"American- laborers- \"reliefers\"","a":{"1":"Slowly","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"1":"","2":""},"o":{"1":"District","2":""},"n":{"1":"Rental","3":"","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"A","2":"","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"Not","2":""},"k":{"1":"Static","2":""},"j":{"1":"None","2":""},"i":{"2":"(1940-Feb.) $300, 1,500","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$300, 1,500","2":"December 30, 1899","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"$300, 1,500","2":""},"f":{"1":"100%","2":""},"e":{"1":"100%","2":""},"d":{"1":"Some good- some dilapidated","2":""},"c":{"1":"1-5 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Frame/tar paper","2":""},"a":{"1":"Single shacks & cottages 2-4 rooms","2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 14, 1900","2":"Shacks/cottages","3":"Built for owners"},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a flat treeless area bordering North Ave. (Ill.

Melrose Park is populated principally by persons of German descent, altho it has been known as an Italian community. Some improvement has been seen here due to a change of local administration and the induction of a new Chief of Police. Despite this improvement, the town has a bad name with lending agencies, and it is quite difficult to secure mortgage loans without FHA provision. About the only company willing to lend here on funds is the Bell Savings Building $ Loans Assn. One developer built about 60 brick bungalows in Melrose Park, which did not sell rapidly enoguh to suit him, whereupon he had his workmen sign contracts for the property and obtained loans from the North American Life Ins. Co., which institution soon became the owner through foreclosure of the bungalows, and is, at present, the principal institutional owner of foreclosed property within this area.

Railroad tracks and industry are along the entire northern boundary and much industry also is located at the southeast; the National Lead Company is located at Peoria and 18th. $3,500 is approximately the top limit for any kind of property; anyone able to pay more goes west. The future of the of the entire blighted area is discouraging; population is decreasing; there is no immigration of foreigners. The younger element, through the use of our educational facilities, obtain a good education and ultimately obtain positions outside to the area. They talk the English language and, as they grow into manhood and womanhood and marry, have no desire to live here, preferring to either rent or buy in the better white sections of the city. The older people, who still talk their native language, do not wish to leve; although, in some case, the younger people have induced them to sell and go along with them. This has not been proven to be (over) satisfactory. The result is that only negro, Mexican, or the low-class white will move in; and these have no money. The future of this area is hopeless, unless by cooperation of the city and county authorities with property owners, some housing projects may be originated and completed, and part of the area rehabilitated through necessary demolishments. These foreigners, having raised their families, now find themselves in the positino of being unable to sell, even if they desired to. Almost every foreign nationality is represented in this section. Throughout the entire area, considerable vandalism occurs. On 19th Street, east from Western, is a mixture of many kinds of buildings; brick and stone, all in poor condition; although, it is noted that the Poles and Bohemians heep their properties up better than the Italians do in their area. Many homes and flats are built below the street level. There are a few party walls in this area. An old quarry, located between 18th and 19th, Lincoln and Wood, is used as a garbage dumping ground and, in summer, the odors from this are extremely offensive. 19th Street, east of Blue Island, becomes somewhat better, with many brick singles, 2s and 3's. A number of tenements exist. Halsted, a business street, north from 22nd, is exceedingly poor, mixed, with all kinds of frames and brick buildings. 18th Place and 22 have a number of 2-flats, cottages, frame and brick. Throughout the area are a number of stores with flats above. On Leavitt Street are many mixed old frame and brick buildings, with some party walls; and on Hoyne, cottages and 2's of frame and brick.

Demand for these inexpensive units has held up fairly well, but because of the age of the buildings and heterogeneous mixture the area can be rated no better than \"C\".","9":{"1":"N/A","2":"3rd","3":"C-85","4":"Oct. 1939"}}},"C82":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/C82/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Rooming house transition","d":"1%","c":{"1":"10%","2":"Mixture"},"b":"Lower middle class","a":{"1":"Yes","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"10%","2":"10%","p":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"o":{"1":"Good- up to $55.00","2":"Fair in smaller; good in larger"},"n":{"1":"(1939) $47.50-57.50","3":"6-","4":"(1939) $7.00-9.00 room","5":"10+"},"m":{"1":"$47.50-55.00 (1938- $50.00-60.00)","2":"5+ (7+)","3":"$6.50-8.00 room","4":"7+"},"l":{"1":"$45.00-52.50","2":"$6.00-7.50 room"},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"j":{"1":"Fair- $8,500-9,500","2":"Fair- up to $6,000"},"i":{"2":"(1939) $8,000-9,500","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"(1939) $5,000-7,500","5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"1":"$8,000-9,500","2":"13+","3":"$5,000-7,500","4":"11+"},"g":{"1":"$7,000-8,500","2":"$4,500-5,750"},"f":{"1":"50%","2":"60%"},"e":{"1":"90%","2":"98%"},"d":{"1":"Fair to poor","2":"Fair to poor"},"c":{"1":"30-35 years","2":"35-40 years"},"b":{"1":"Brick","2":"Frame (60%); brick (40%)"},"a":{"1":"Three-family; 6 rooms","2":"One-family; 7-9 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"January 4, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 3, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Approximately 10 per cent of the structures in the area are two-family brick homes in fair condition selling in the price bracket of $5,500 to $8,500.

Altho the district is predominantly residential , there is considerable small and large business scattered throughout. The section has no future and that portion south of Division St. is very definitely blighted. The blight is extending north to that point and may be expected to eventually envelop the entire territory. Housing accommodations are, in most cases, little more than minimum shelter and many units have no inside baths. In addition to the residential properties noted above, there are a number of old-fashioned 6 and 8-flat units, which gives the territory a most heterogeneous appearance. In some cases there are two buildings on the same lot, one of course being an alley property. Negro population is largely concentrated south of Division St., and west of Wells St., but a continued infiltration of this race has caused an overflow north of that point; and it is reasonable to assume that the section may eventually become more negro than Italian, which is the other predominating population class residing in this section today. (over) The area is highly congested; streets are dirty and alleys are strewn with refuse. There is a very heavy traffic flow both north and south, and east and west. Industrial encroachment from the south and west will probably gradually decrease the size of this section from a residential standpoint. A Government housing project is planned for the two blocks west of Sedgwick, running from Chicago to Division. A private housing projected erected by the Marshall Field Estate, which occupies the ground between Evergreen St. and Blackhawk St., one block west of Sedgwick, has been comparatively successful, although rents in these buildings are not competitive with surrounding properties. Trend of desirability, from a residential point of view, continues steadily downward; but, because of the favorable location of the district from the point of accessibility to employment centers, this should be a logical place for further slum clearance projects. The area is much more mixed than the classification above would indicate, for there is no indication of uniformity of structures or design, and most units are in a sad state of disrepair. In the southwest corner many houses have been converted to multi-family use, even utilizing attics and basements for living quarters.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"4th","3":"D-30","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"D31":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D31/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Transient population","d":"0%","c":{"1":"20%","2":"Mixed"},"b":"Lower class- lower middle class","a":{"1":"","2":"Slowly","3":""}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"o":{"1":"Good","2":""},"n":{"1":"(1940-Mar.) $50.00-75.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"$50.00-75.00","2":"January 13, 1900","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"$45.00-65.00","2":""},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"j":{"1":"Fair","2":""},"i":{"2":"(1940-Mar.) $8,000-10,000","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$8,000-10,000","2":"December 30, 1899","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"$8,000-10,000","2":""},"f":{"1":"Low","2":""},"e":{"1":"98%","2":""},"d":{"1":"Fair to poor","2":""},"c":{"1":"50-60 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Brick","2":""},"a":{"1":"One family 7-10 rms.","2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 5, 1900"},"6":"Very limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a very convenient location, immediately adjacent to the Chicago loop on the near north side.

There has also been considerable conversion of large homes and apartment house units into 2 and 3-room kitchenette apartments. Most properties are built immediately adjoining, with a maximum setback of about 15 feet. State and Dearborn both carry very heavy traffic and, because of the high use of the land, the appearance of the neighborhood is somewhat congested. Chicago's famous Ambassador Hotel is located on the northwest corner of State and Goethe. It is somewhat unfair to this district to say that it is declining in general desirability; but, because of its age and obsolescence (the latter being minimized by reconditioning and remodeling) the area is, nevertheless, graded third class because of its general appearance. Due consideratino must be given to the location, because of its convenience to Lake Michigan beaches and downtown Chicago. (over) Generally speaking, it is comparatively homogeneous and continues to attract fairly good class people and it is doubtful that any infiltration of noticeably less desirable tenants will soon occur. The ground is now 100 per cent built up, but restrictinos on State St. permit buildings of more than three stories and there is reason to believe that favorable locations may be replaced with large apartment house units, although activity iin this class of structure is arrested in Chicago at the present time. Construction costs indicate that rentals must average at least $17.00 per room to encourage any construction of apartments in an area of this kind. In the portion of the area south of Division St., buildings are quite uniformly 3 story, row type units, also favorably occupied and in good demand, but somewhat older than those properties north of Division St. These streets are probably even more congested than those north of Division St., but trend of desirability compares favorably throughout this entire section.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"3rd","3":"C-157","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"B95":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/B95/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"15% Jewish in houses because of restriction in apts.","d":"0%","c":{"1":"0%","2":""},"b":"Upper class- upper middle class","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"75%","2":"25%","p":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"o":{"1":"Good- fewer available","2":"Soft- larger units; Good-small units"},"n":{"1":"(1940-Mar.) $200.00-350.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"$27.50-35-in large units (6r or more); $40.00-50-in small units","5":"10-"},"m":{"1":"$200.00-350.00","2":"18+","3":"","4":"20+"},"l":{"1":"$165.00-300.00","2":""},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"j":{"1":"Fair","2":""},"i":{"2":"","3":"","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"","2":"","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"No Market","2":""},"f":{"1":"60%","2":""},"e":{"1":"93%- increasing","2":"80% in large; 97% in small"},"d":{"1":"Good","2":"Good"},"c":{"1":"30 years","2":"15-20 years"},"b":{"1":"Stone- some brick","2":"Brick"},"a":{"1":"One family 7-15 rooms","2":"Apts- 4-15 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"40-50% @ 4 1/2-5% Ins.

In many respects it compares to the Back Bay section of Boston, for it is very conveniently located, has high-class occupancy, has seen considerable remodeling and reconditioning and reduction of size of units in some of the large apartment buildings. Altho properties are built comparatively close to the sidewalk and (illegible comment) adjoining walls, trend of desirability continues static and demand is good from persons who want an \"in town\" location. Astor St. has only local traffic and, as such, is a better residential street than State or Dearborn. It is also restricted against more than 3 story buildings at the north end, whereas, in the south no restriction is operative on Dearborn or State. They, therefore, have some speculative value for demolition and erection of apartment house units. Real estate taxes are exceptionally high. There are several cooperative apartment buildings at the south end of Astor. Rentals on apartment units of 6 rooms and more are slightly weak at the present time; but, on smaller units, they are very strong. The trend of reducing these bigger units to smaller kitchenette apartments (over) may be expected to continue. In spite of its age, the area continues to attract very high-class people and, in many respects, the district is equally desirable as Lake Shore Drive, because of its seclusion from the heavy traffic. Transportation is by bus along the Drive. Lake Michigan beaches are convenient and generally considered favorable, altho they do attract a much less desirable class of persons from sections to the west. A few of the houses are operated as rooming houses, but most properties are so strongly held that it is doubtful if the district will ever become a rooming house district in its entirety. Neighborhood is graded second class because of the good class occupancy and because it continues as a desirable residential sectino in spite of its advancing age.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"2nd","3":"B-95","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"A34":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"A","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/A34/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"1":"0%","2":""},"b":"Upper middle class- upper class","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"90%","2":"","p":{"1":"","2":""},"o":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"n":{"1":"Good- small units","3":"10-","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"$27.50-35.00 a room- large units; $40.00-45.00 a room- small units","2":"20+","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"","2":""},"k":{"1":"","2":""},"j":{"1":"","2":""},"i":{"2":"","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"","2":"","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"","2":""},"f":{"1":"","2":""},"e":{"1":"90% in large units; 97% in small units","2":""},"d":{"1":"Good","2":""},"c":{"1":"15-25 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Brick","2":""},"a":{"1":"Apartments- 4-15 rooms","2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"O","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This section is generally known as Chicago's Gold Coast. With the exception of a few old, one-faimly residences scattered along the Drive north of Oak St., the bulk of the structures are large apartments and apartment hotels. The exclusive Drake Hotel is located at the southeast corner of Michigan and Oak St. In a number of thesee buildings were units originally ran up to as many as 15 rooms, conversion to smaller-size units has been successful in reducing a heavy vacancy to less than 10 per cent in apartments of six rooms and less. Several of the one-family homes are old Chicago landmarks and include such well-known structures as the Potter Palmer Mansion; these will probably be eventually replaced by apartments similar to those now located along the Drive. there aer several vacant parcels of ground which are presently available for such construction, but development of this character is arrested and it is somewhat doubtful that any immediate high-class apartment construction will occur. The street overlooks Lake Michigan, which is a favorable influence; convenience to downtown Chicago is attractive to persons who want an \"in town\" location. Public (over) school attendance is necessarily of a very cosmopolitan character, due to the proximity of the very poor areas lying west of Clark St. An attempt is now being made, however, to secure a public school location east of Dearborn St. and north of Chicago Ave., with a district restriction to confine attendance to only those children living east of Clark. Should this prove successful, it is reasonable to assume that the entire area would be somewhat more appealing to families with youngsters of grade school age. The bulk of the children today go to private schools. Because of the lack of competition in this class of building, and the high-class occupancy, the section is rated first class, although it does not meet any of the requirements of a typical first class residential neighborhood.","9":{"1":"Chicago","2":"1st","3":"A-34","4":"Mar. 1940"}}},"B96":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/B96/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"c":{"1":"0%","2":""},"b":"Middle & upper middle class","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"},"e":"","d":"0%"},"2":{"1":"95%","2":"","p":{"1":"Up on 2 & 3 room units","2":""},"o":{"1":"Good","2":""},"n":{"1":"(1940-Mar.) $25.00 a rm.-5rms & largerl $30-35.00 a rm.

On 13th, cottages, 2's and 3's of brick construction prevail, with a few spotted better-class buildings interspersed. On Washburn are mostly brick 2's, some 3's, singles and a few 4's; somewhat better up-keep evident; many different kinds of architecture; some vandalism. St. Charles Roman Catholic School and Church is located at Roosevelt and Hoyne. The outlook for the future of this area is hopeless.

St. Mary's Girls High School is at Grenshaw and Hoyne. At Flournoy and Laflin is the McLaren School. On Ashland Boulevard, homes are of somewhat better appearance, mostly stone, some brick; all converted into union homes. On Marshfield are many 2's and 3's, stone; and north of Taylor, many party walls near Flournoy. The Chicago Mail Order Company is at Harrison and Marshfield; and the Cook County Hospital at Wolcott, Wood, Harrison and Polk. Polk Street, east of Western for several blocks, is poor, with old, small frame dwellings. On both sides of Claremont, north of Polk, are many brick party walls. On Oakley, between Harrison and Roosevelt, are 2's, brick and stone, and a few more substantial type of residences. Campbell Boulevard, between Oakley and Leavitt, is comprised of 2's, brick and stone, of good appearance. The city maintains (over) this boulevard; a driveway exists on each side of it. On Leavitt, south of Harrison to Roosevelt, are many party walls, stone and brick. A Nurses' Home, a large, pretentious building, is at Polk and Lincoln; and at Wolcott and Polk is the State Medical School of Illinois University. There is much vandaliism throughout the area; the future appears hopeless. Rush Medical College is at Harrison and Wood; and a proposition, still alive, exists to turn that portion of the area between Leavitt and Paulina, West Congress to West Roosevelt, into a huge medical center. This would materially assist the surrounding properties, as it would mean the establishment of parks, apartment buildings, and business houses, etc. A few hospitals already in the area are the Cook County Hospital, University Hospital, Presbyterian Hospital, and Loyola University Medical School. The area is one that will continue to be a problem, unless demolishment and rehabilitation becomes a fact. Age and obsolescence is such that no private money for development purposes will come into the section. The trend of Italians today is toward the west.","9":{"1":"Southwest Chicago","2":"4th","3":"D-38","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"D40":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D40/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"As above","d":"100%","c":{"1":"N/A","2":""},"b":"Relief, WPA, Laborers, low wage-earners","a":{"1":"Yes","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"25%","2":"75%","p":{"1":"Static- down","2":"Static"},"o":{"1":"Good up to above","2":"Poor"},"n":{"1":"$15.00-20.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"Same as 1937 (unheated)","5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"1":"$15.00-20.00","2":"December 30, 1899","3":"Same as 1935","4":"December 30, 1899"},"l":{"1":"$15.00-20.00","2":"$15.00-20.00 per flat"},"k":{"1":"Down","2":"Down"},"j":{"1":"Poor","2":"Fair.

Majority of people are on relief. The area is rapidly deteriorating; badly blighted; and colored expansion is expected to continue north and west. Many demolishments are scattered throughout; also, a number of buildings boarded up. Very little difference exists in price values between 2's and 3's, the 2's being more popular. Property owners who can dispose of their properties to the colored element move west; those who cannot, rent. The Illinois State University Hospital and School of Medicine is located between Taylor and Polk, Wood to Damen. North of Polk is the Cook County Hospital; the Cook County Nurses' Home (exclusively for nurses) lies between Winchester and Lincoln, Polk to Harrison. These buildings adjoin the area and compose what is known as a medical and dental district. Demolishments and medical buildings have thwarted the negro's growth in this particular section. The only hope for this blighted colored area is a few more Jane Adams Projects; or demolishment and rehabilitation on a large scale, undertaken by the city, county or federal authorities in (over) conjunction with owners. The Jane Adams Project, located north of the area between Racine and Loomis, is highly spoken of; but is only a \"flea-bite\" when compared with the large blighted district surrounding it. In the eastern end of the area is the Maxwell Street open-air market, called the \"Ghetto\", which runs for about three blocks east of Halsted. Some attempt is being made to regulate this eye-sore and encourage more sanitary measures; little evidence appears today of this object being attained. East of Ashland are a few white families of Irish and Polish extraction. Damen Street is exceedingly poor. North on Paulina from Roosevelt are colored families on the east. 13th Street, east of Racine, is badly blighted, a mixture of all sorts of buildings, mostly brick 2's and 3's. No mortgage money available anywhere; also few steam-heated rooms. Whenever a residential vacancy exists, vandalism immediately occurs on a large scale, with little or no interference. Years ago this area was all Irish, supplnated by Jews, who gave way to Italians, followed by colored, Mexicans, Greeks, etc. At present, the Chicago Housing Authority is engaged in checking the territory nort of the Jane Adams Project and another project, still alive, hopes to interest city, county, state and private enterprise, inclusing the Mayo Brothers, Rochester, toward the development of a large medical center which would lie between Leavitt and Paulina, Congress and Roosevelt Road. This would mean the demolishment and rehabilitation of a great portion of the area, replaced by hospitals, nurses' homes, attendant retail business establishments, apartment buildings, parks, etc. In this area are the University of Chicago Hospital, the Presbyterian Hospital, the Senn Memorial Hospital, the Loyola University School of Medicine, Rush Medical Laboratories, Chicago College of Dental Surgery, the Rockefeller-McCormick Institue, etc.; and in addition, many churches and other institutions. People in the area live from day to day; many have no money to bury members of their family and collections for funerals are not infrequent. This blighted area will continue to be an increasing menace.","9":{"1":"Southwest Chicago","2":"4th","3":"D-40","4":"Jan. 1940"}}},"D41":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D41/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"As above","d":"0%","c":{"1":"95%","2":"Predominately Italian, few Mexicans & Greeks"},"b":"Laborer, WPA","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"25%","2":"75%","p":{"1":"Static","2":"Static"},"o":{"1":"Good up to above","2":"Fair"},"n":{"1":"$15.00-20.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"$15.00-20.00","5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"1":"$15.00-20.00","2":"December 30, 1899","3":"$15.00-20.00","4":"December 30, 1899"},"l":{"1":"$15.00-20.00","2":"$15.00-20.00"},"k":{"1":"Down","2":"Down"},"j":{"1":"Poor","2":"Poor"},"i":{"2":"$1,800-2,500","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"Same as 1937","5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"1":"$1,800-2,500","2":"December 30, 1899","3":"Same as 1935","4":"December 30, 1899"},"g":{"1":"$1,800-2,500","2":"(2)- $1,750-3,000; (3)- $3,000-3,800"},"f":{"1":"90%","2":"50%"},"e":{"1":"95%","2":"90%"},"d":{"1":"Poor","2":"Fair"},"c":{"1":"55 years","2":"(Majority are old, spotted 35-55 years- with some around 35 years)"},"b":{"1":"Brick and frame","2":"Brick and frame"},"a":{"1":"Single cottages; 5-6R","2":"Two and three-flats"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"January 2, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 4, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Located between Harrison & Roosevelt, Halsted to Ashland, composed almost entirely of foreigners, Italian predominating.

At times 3's can be purchased cheaper than 2's, purchaser preferring to be relieved of the third flat, due to undesirable class of tenant procurable in area. Some basement flats rent at $6.00 per month. Many demolishments, which are increasing; much vandalism is apparent. Mexicans are scattered thruout, as well as other foreign elements. Future of this blighted district is hopeless unless thru demolishments, buildings are erected similar in character to the Jane Adams Court Bldg Project, for which there is now a large waiting list of tenants. Projects of this nature would be popular, due to excellent quick transportatino into the Loop a short distance away. The Project is now operated by the City of Chgo and is located within the following boundaries:- between Cabrina and Roosevelt, roughly west of Racine to Loomis. Apartments are 3, 4, and 5 rooms and average rent approximately $20.00 per month. This building has helped the area immediately adjacent. It is (over) reported as well-managed; well-kept; and hygenic, although along Roosevelt, between Racine and Throop, are apartments rented to colored people. In the vicinity of Halsted and Blue Island is a concentration of Mexicans and Greeks. The Vernon Park district is extremely decadent, with many frame homes 75-80 years of age. At Polk and Miller was located the heart of Chicago Gangland in the old Capone days, where occurred many killings and injuries amongst Italians, Sicilians and others. Polk Street has many old frame 2's and 3's, a few brick; much rehabilitation required; terribly blighted; the entire area is just as bad, if not worse, than the large colored blighted area where Chicago's three hundred odd thousand colored people live. Cabrina Hospital is located at Racine and Cabrina. At the present time, the Chicago Housing Authority is interested in the territory immeditely north of the Jane Adams Court Building Apartments. On Polk and Ada, facing the park, are many stone party walls. There are no outsiders coming in, and the area is losing in population.

Residences command a better rental bracket than 2's and 3's, due to size and number of rooms; and residential values are firmer than in adjoining area. Little difference exists in values between residences and 2's and 3's, due to adaptability of large homes for use as rooming houses. The Crane Technical School is at Jackson, Van Buren, Oakley and Bell. Jackson Blvd, east from Western Ave., is composed almost entirely of brick and stone residences converted, some 2's and 3's; and becomes lower-grade east of Damen. Part walls exist. Interspersed throughout the area are light manufacturing industries and small retail business stores. On Congress are many brick part walls, a few singles converted, spotted with light manufacturing. West of Wood are a number of 3's, party walls, interspersed with busienss, few frames. Leavitt Street, north of Adams, is exceptionally poor; mixed, singles of brick and 2's and 3's. On Monroe Street, west from Leavitt, are brick and stone residences converted; party walls; many commerical houses. A fair to good demand exists for rooming houses, both for rent and purchase. Much vandalism appears, although some buildings are boarded up. Wieboldt Store, a large chain department store, is at Ogden, Ashland, Monroe and Adams. A cheaper grade of rooming house is east of Ashland; and on Monroe, east of Loomis, are many light manufacturing industries. The area is level; rapidly deteriorating; blighted; and composed of a mixed population. University Hospital is on the northwest corner of Winchester and Congress; and south of Congress, on Winchester to Polk, east to Wood, north to Congress, west to Honore, is located the Presbyterian Hospital, Cook County Hospital, Illinois Research Hospital, University of Illinois Medical School, Rush Medical School and Loyola University Medical School. Sales turnover are fairly active; but, only on long term purchases, 10 per cent down, or $200 or $300 cash. That section west of Ogden is somewhat better than east.

In general, north of the Illinois Central Railroad is somewhat less desirable than the territory lying south of this line and west of the Elevated railway (Westchester Blvd.) Construction shown on the map is entirely two-family brick dwellings. East of this boulevard are almost entirely brick bungalows. LaGrange Road (U.S. Route 45/12) is the western boundary shown on the map, and along the west side of this boulevard is a large cemetery, while at the very northwest tip of the village as shown on the map is a large and active stone quarry. However, these are not of any great influence on present residential development, which is more influenced by the fact that there are no \"eyesores\" near at hand, and direct transportation via the Elevated railway is available. Demand is slow at present, but very likely to improve as this village develops. It is understood that one of the principal developers in the Chicago area has acquired large acreage in Westchester for future development. (over) Heavy assessments originally put on in 1929 have retarded Westchester to a great extent. These approximate $25.00 a foot plus interest, which brings the total to about $40.00 a foot where no payments have been made from the inception of the assessments. Shopping facilities are very remote and limited. Churches are inaccessible, but there is a good small grammar school at the southeast portion of the built-up area. High school is about 4 miles distant in Maywood. The Chicago Title & Trust CO. has been substantially interested in Westchester. Paving bonds are held by the original paving contractor, who is not inclined to reduce his claim. Lots which are readily mortgaged at abotu $1,000 each, due to special assessments, must bring from $2,500-3,000 in order to satisfy all claimants. A recent offer of $1,000 a piece for 40 acres of these lots was not accepted. Provided some compromise can be affected, partially writing off these speical assessments, Westchester should normally see rapid development; which would justify a second grade; but due to present poor convenience and lack of amenities is graded only \"C plus\".","9":{"1":"Westchester, Ill.","2":"High 3rd","3":"C-132","4":"Feb. 1940"}}},"C178":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/C178/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Gradual infiltration Czechs from Berwyn & Cicero","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"Bohemians- Germans"},"b":"Mechanics- artisans","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"N/A","2":"","p":{"1":"Firm","2":""},"o":{"1":"Good up to $35.00","2":""},"n":{"1":"(1939-Nov.) $30.00-35.00","3":"","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"$28.00-32.50","2":"","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"$25.00-30.00","2":""},"k":{"1":"Static","2":""},"j":{"1":"Poor","2":""},"i":{"2":"(1939-Nov.) $3,500-4,500","3":"","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$3,500-4,500","2":"","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"$3,500-4,500","2":""},"f":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":""},"e":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":""},"d":{"1":"Fair","2":""},"c":{"1":"15 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Frame","2":""},"a":{"1":"Singles detached bungalows 4-5 rooms","2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 1, 1900","2":"Singles- $5,000","3":"Built for owners"},"4":{"b":"January 2, 1900","a":"December 30, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"1; 0"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Terrain is flat and practically treeless, and about 50 oer cent improved.

Through the whole Stock Yard district, the number of immense, well-built Polish churches is very noticeable, making a striking contrast as compared with the poor class of home.","9":{"1":"Southwest Chicago","2":"D","3":"March 9, 1900","4":"February 1, 1940"}}},"D70":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D70/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"As above","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"Polish, Bohemian, and Lithuanian"},"b":"Low unskilled labor","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899","n":{"1":"(1940-Feb.) $12.00-22.00","3":"","4":"(1940-Feb.) $18.00-24.00 (stove heat)","5":""},"m":{"1":"$12.00-22.00","2":"","3":"$18.00-24.00","4":""},"l":{"1":"$12.00-22.00","2":"$18.00-24.00"},"k":{"1":"Static","2":"Static"},"j":{"1":"Poor","2":"Poor"},"i":{"2":"Same as 1937","3":"","4":"Same as 1937","5":""},"h":{"1":"Same as 1935","2":"","3":"Same as 1935","4":""},"g":{"1":"(B) $2,000-3,250; (F) $1,800-2,750","2":"(F) $2,500-3,750; (B) $3,000-4,750"},"f":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"e":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"d":{"1":"Poor","2":"Poor"},"c":{"1":"40-45 years","2":"40 years"},"b":{"1":"Frame (predominant) brick","2":"Frame and brick"},"a":{"1":"Cottages; 4-6 rooms","2":"Two's; few others"},"p":{"1":"Static","2":"Static"},"o":{"1":"Good to above","2":"Good to above"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"B&L 6%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Located between Hoyne and Halsted, south of 43rd to 51st, another predominantly foreign area, inhabited by Poles, Lithuanians, and Bohemians.

Vacant lots sell for approximately $15-20 per front foot; there is little demand. School facilities are far; transportation good. It is predominately foreign-born; namely, Bohemian, Polish, and Lithuanian. Wage-earners are in the low salary bracket. Construction is cheap, with little change in style or architecture. The area was constructed by various contractors, buildin homes by blocks. There are a number of 2's, with 3 1/2 and 4-room apartments. 2's and 3's are slow in selling. Some of the 3's haave 7 and 8 rooms. About 90 per cent of the 2's have peaked roofs, and the majority of them have separate heating for each apartment (hot water on the first floor and stove heat on the second). At Kedzie and 79th will be an under and over pass shortly, which will provide better facilities for going in and out of the area. Southwest, or Columbus Highway, adjoins the southeast part of the area at Western. South of 71st to 73rd, no the east of Sacramento to California, are a number of brick 2's, with scattered singles. On Mozart are old, cheap brick bungalows. California Avenue is mostly 2-flats, mixed with frame and brick singles.

It has been on the down grade for some time. An effort, however, is being made by improvement clubs, bankers, and brokers to prevent further decline. Captains have been appointed to many blocks in an endeavor to instill a pride of ownership and see what can be done toward painting and rehabilitating some of these old homes which, in the case of frame, average 50 yrs., and brick 35. There are colored people two blocks to the north. Between Ashland and Racine, between 71st and 74th (which is the younger section) 95 per cent are single homes; 80 per cent frame, with many large apartments of 6-24 units scattered throughout on the corners. Many old frames in the area are being converted into 2-family homes. Between 63rd and 74th, Ashland to Racine, 98 per cent are owner-occupied. There are some brick 3's of somewhat newer constructinon in the price bracket of $7,000. Many homes are of brick construction, some built below the street. Between 63rd and 75th, Halsted to Racine, conditions are somewhat similar to the aforesaid, with the exception that there are about a dozen colored families on Carpenter and Aberdeen between 65th and 66th- very spotted. Between 64th and 67th, Stewart to Yale, is probably the best residential district in the area, with some frames as high as $8,000. Large apartment construction in the area was stopped during depression, but is expected to be resumed. Something drastic ultimately must be done. The area should be rebuilt with better homes; there are numbers of them of cheap construction which can easily be demolished. East of Wentworth to State is somewhat identical as to (over) type of building. The better part of the area east of Wallace is adjacent to Hamilton Park between 71st and 74th. The consistently best street in the whole area is Halsted Avenue. Eggleston, north from 65th, has many frame singles, 60-70 years old, very spotted. At 69th and Ashland are big streetcar barns and yards- detrimental. Section aaround 71st Pl., 72nd, and 72nd Pl., and 73rd, west of Racine to Ashland, presents a somewhat better appearance. Schewbridge Field, a large play field, lies south of 74th east of Racine. Stewart Street, south of 74th, as many old apartments. On the east side, between 74th and 73rd, are many party-wall buildings, with brick both in front and rear and frame in the middle. Many poor shacks on this street. South on Lowe from 63rd are coal yards. On 66th, west of Wallace, are many row houses, spotted with mixed constructino. Morgan Street, going north from 69th to 63rd, has recently been widened and an entire new street put down. Many poor frames. The street is now a high-speed highway- detrimental. 63rd and Halsted is said to be the busiest business district in Chicago outside of the Loop. On the west side of Loomis, facing Ogden Park, are some fair homes, with a few two's. This entire area is extremely spotted with old construction of all kinds, with a decidedly poor general, congested appearance. About 75 per cent of the district are two's, many of these 6-7 rooms. Around Normal Parkway are better grade homes and apartments with a better rent bracket. The section south of 75th, east of Harvard to State, is somewhat better than some parts of the area. Singles and 2's of brick construction are not so old, but a few old frames are spotted throughout.","9":{"1":"South Chicago","2":"D","3":"March 23, 1900","4":"December 1, 1939"}}},"D74":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D74/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Negro","d":"December 31, 1899","c":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":""},"b":"Laborer, relief, etc.","a":{"1":"Yes","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899","p":{"1":"Static- up","2":"Static- up"},"o":{"1":"Good up to $60.00","2":"Good"},"n":{"1":"$35.00-60.00","3":"","4":"Same as '35 and '37 (all heated)","5":""},"m":{"1":"$32.50-57.50","2":"","3":"(4R) $35.00-45.00; (5R) $40.00-50.00; (6R) $45.00-60.00; (7-8) $50.00-75.00","4":""},"l":{"1":"$30.00-55.00","2":"(4R) $35.00-45.00; (5R) $40.00-50.00; (6R) $45.00-60.00; (7-8) $50.00-75.00"},"k":{"1":"Static- down","2":"Static- down"},"j":{"1":"Better demand than '35; Good up to $5,000 on small payments","2":"Good up to above"},"i":{"2":"$2,500-7,500","3":"","4":"(2) $2,500-6,000; (3) $3,000-7,500","5":""},"h":{"1":"$2,500-6,350","2":"","3":"(2) $2,500-6,000; (3) $3,000-7,500","4":""},"g":{"1":"$2,500-5,500","2":"(2) $2,300-5,500; (3) $2,700-7,000"},"f":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"e":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":"December 31, 1899"},"d":{"1":"Fair- good","2":"Fair- good"},"c":{"1":"40 years","2":"40-50 years"},"b":{"1":"Brick","2":"Brick"},"a":{"1":"Residences; 6-10 rooms","2":"A few 2's only; ap't blgs; 3's 6's and up"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"December 31, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"February 17, 1900"},"6":"None","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Located between 35th and 67th, west of Cottage Grove to State, a blighted area, 100 per cent negro, predominantly apartment buildings; 3's, 6's and up, few 2's. Single homes are of the 6-10 room type, average age 40 years. In this area under construction is the Ida B. Wells US Housing Project, extending from 37th to 39th between South Parkway and Cottage Grove. This proejct is expected to house 1,662 negro families and, of course, will be taken off the tax rolls with the exception of taxes for police, fire and school purposes. This venture has the realtors guessing as to what the ultimate result will be when so many of this race are drawn into this section from the already negro-blighted district; particularly its effect on the section east and south of Cottage Grove, and to park and water frontage on Lake Michigan. Already Washington Park at the south, a very fine park, has been almost completely monopolized by the colored race. Criticism is heard of the locatino of the proejct, some believing it should have been located north of Oakwood and west of Indiana in order to keep the colored influence as far as possible from further encroaching on park and lake water frontage. Others believe that a location south of 35th, extending (over) to Garfield Boulevard between State and the Rock Island RR, would have been preferably and a large fire hazard eliminated; property adjoining the railroad used as a playground, and landscaped with trees, shrubs, etc. NOTE: At the southeast corner of South Parkway and 60th, a brick apartment house of at least 24 flats in a restrited area is reported as owned by Joe Louis. * A small colored B&L organization, the Illinois Federal B&L, is located at 62 E. 47th St. *Three's on South Parkway and Michigan Avenue would run up to $10,000. A remodeling of buildings, stores, etc., by property owners on State Street would have resulted; and the cost of the project less. Rooms in a housing project should be in keeping with the average pockets of the neighborhood, which is said to be from $4.50 to $5.00 per room. With approximately 6,500 colored people moving into this district, it is evident they cannot be closed in; they must have an outlet; and the problem of keeping park and water frontage close by reasonably free of them will be difficult to surmount. The trend of the colored people will no be accelerated toward this park and water frontage, which many people consider could have been avoided had it been located west of Indiana. That section of the area between 35th and 39th, Cottage Grove to Lake Park Avenue, is restricted to whites; but, there are a number of colored families on Ellis Avenue between 37th and 35th, and it is believed (particularly since the advent of the housing project) that this entire section will ultimately go colored, which will increase the number of colored people using the lake front. Washington Park is already doomed. Throughout the entire area aer many vacant lots for which there is no market, due in part to the class of inhabitant and age of improvements. Rehabilitation also is a negligible factor. Instead of demolishing or rehabilitating some of these properties, it might be better to dispose of them than increase vacant property which has little value today. An organization known as the Hyde-Park-Kenwood Protective Organization is endeavoring to keep that section south of 35th to Pershing, east of Cottage Grove (which is restricted) white; but, with at least 25 colored families already in, white people hesitate to buy or rent- colored people will. South of 35th to Marquette, east of State, homes and flats are of a better type; also a better class of colored inhabitant. On Michigan, south of 55th are a number of large, 3-story, brick construction residences. On South Parkway, between 61st and 63rd east to Cottage Grove, are some large apartment buildings being taken over by colored people. Between 66th and Marquette, east of State, is a small section of comparatively good brick bungalows and 2's, some frames. Here a better class of colored people reside. There is nothing for sale or rent, and many applicants for both. This section is fairly old, however. Washington Park on the southeast of the area is almost 90 per cent used by negroes. It is one of the better city parks, with good swimming pools. The pools are so popular in summer time that the colored children are allowed in for one hour only at a time, when a new shift occurs. At South Parkway and 45th is a substantial new building being erected to hosue the Metropolitan Funeral Parlors and Insurance Organizations- all colored. The first settlement of the colored people was south of 22nd to 47th, west of State to Wentworth. The next movement was west of Michigan, where they joined forces at State. Michigan Avenue and South Parkway were the last to go colored about 15 years ago. The rapid development in South Chicago in the 20's of new subdivisions, homes, apartments, etc., caused a vacation of buildings on a large scale, and colored people moved in. The Stockyard Boom during the war is estimated to have brought in about 10,000 families from the South; and in the area at present under discussion, together with adjoining area, is a colored population estimated between 300,000 and 350,000. South of Washington Park sales of properties are said to be taking place to Jews and others, who hold title and rent to colored families. No mortgage money available north of 63rd, between Cottage Grove and Halsted. One of the problems is to find means of helping these people aid themselves. Already colored people are in various businesses, but the majority of the business is controlled by Jews. Our contract broker exhibited a list of approximately 500 applications at present on file from responsible colored people looking for homes to purchase; and no matter how small a flat is, it is usually rented to from eight people and up, who sleep in shifts.* If a responsible mortgage corporation, building and loan or otherwise, composed of colored people could be established it would aid rehabilitation and the turnover of all properties. Property values and rents have increased since 1935 an estimated 30 per cent, but only to colored people. Large apartment buildings are located on Michigan, Indiana, Prairie, Calume and South Parkway south of 47th; also north of Washington Park between Cottage Grove and South Parkway, between 43rd and 51st, with a sprinkiling of singles. 2's, 3's and 6's are located on Wabash, Indiana, Prairie and Calumet between 35th and 63rd. On the corners are the larger buildings; at Wabash and Garfield is the Schulte Bakery (Butternut Bread) industry. Transportation good. The center of this huge colored area is located att 47th and South Parkway. From this hub the colored business activity radiates. It is believed that, unless various rel estate protective associations are strong enough to restrict the colored people, ultimately they will spread over that territory east of Cottage Grove between 39th and 47th. Between 35th and 55th, along South Parkway (formerly Grand Boulevard) are many high-grade residences and apartments. At one time many of Chicago's elite presided here. At Bowen Avenue and Cottage Grove was located the first Walgreen Drug store organization. At 49th and South Parkway is the Corpus Christi Catholic Church, at one time a wealthy, high-grade parish, now ministering almost entirely to colored people. At 61st and Michigan is the St. Columbanus Catholic church, to which the same has happened; and again a similar experience has happened to the Holy Angels Catholic church on Oakwood and Vincennes. At 39th and Hampden is a large apartment building with over 100 apartments. A bad section of the area exists between 51st and 59th on Calumet and Prairie, where the moral influence is far from good. It is emphasized that one of the most important necessities is to provide a means of financing these colored homes so that they may be rehabilitated; provide a larger turnover of property; and hold these people within the area. East of State rooms are steam-heated; west of State, stove heated.","9":{"1":"South Chicago","2":"D","3":"March 14, 1900","4":"January 1, 1940"}}},"D71":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D71/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"As above, including negro","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"Mixed, Irish, Italian"},"b":"Laborer, lower salary bracket","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899","p":{"1":"Static","2":"Static"},"o":{"1":"Fair up to above","2":"Fair up to $45.00"},"n":{"1":"$20.00-35.00","3":"","4":"$35.00-50.00","5":""},"m":{"1":"$20.00-35.00","2":"","3":"$35.00-50.00","4":""},"l":{"1":"$19.00-32.50","2":"$35.00-45.00"},"k":{"1":"Static- down","2":"Static- down"},"j":{"1":"Poor a/c colored, low wage","2":"Fair up to $5,250"},"i":{"2":"$2,500-5,000","3":"","4":"$3,500-6,000","5":""},"h":{"1":"$2,500-5,000","2":"","3":"$3,500-6,000","4":""},"g":{"1":"$2,500-4,750","2":"$3,500-5,500"},"f":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"e":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"d":{"1":"Fair","2":"Fair"},"c":{"1":"40-50 years","2":"40-50 years"},"b":{"1":"Frame and brick","2":"Frame and brick"},"a":{"1":"Residences; 5-6 rooms","2":"Mostly 2-flats"}},"3":{"1":"January 9, 1900","2":"Sgles; brick 5-7R; $8,000","3":"Owners"},"4":{"b":"","a":"January 3, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 6, 1900"},"6":"Limited, 6% FHA B&L","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"Located west of Halsted to Ashland, between Garfield and 63rd, many foreigners, Irish and Italian predominant.

Area is fairly uniform as to type of homes and flats, altho spotted; rentals are low. Within colored boundaries, no property is for sale or rent; outside this section properties are sold as is, sales low. A problem territory where rehabilitation might pay. Colored section is oldest part of area. About 10 new homes have been built for colored people on Loomis; FHA insured; around $8,000; financed, it is believed, thru a colored insurance company. That part between Halsted and Racine is comprised chiefly of brick 2's, some frame; from Racine to Ashland bungalows and residences predominate, with a few 2's. Colored families are scattered around the colored area, particularly on Aberdeen 63rd to 59th, whih makes sales to whites difficult; and Racine is a poor street with many colored, although 55th to 59th is fair, becoming better toward Halsted. A Copernicus school recess looks as if 90% of the children are negro. About the only way to stimulate white purchases is to rehabilitate homes and make them attractive. Loomis presents a better appearance, with single bungalows, many stucco. Ada and 59th are poor streets. On Peoria are many 2's in fair condition. An area with an uncertain future; transportation fair; known as part of the old Englewood district or West Englewood.

North on Greenwood between 47th and 46th are many frames. Shakespeare School is at 46th and Greenwood. Between 45th and 46th, on the west side of Greenwood are mostly detached residences, while on the east side all are block houses. Mayor Kelly of Chicago, until six months ago, resided at 4821 Ellis. He recently deeded his home to the Bishop of Chicago. At 47th and Ellis is a Catholic church and school.

Recently a 46-apartment building on the west side of South Park Avenuew went Colored, and some 3-6 flat buildings between 61st and 62nd Street also went Colored October 1, 1939.

Most of the new building has occurred on Sangamon Street. There is also some on Morgan south of 99th Street, and a few scattered new homes on Aberdeen and May Streets. From 97th Street south between Vincennes and Carpenter Streets are many frame homes and the oldest part of the area is between 100th and 106th Street, between Vincennes and Morgan. Foreign people are largely concentrated south of 103rd Street. This is partly due to the convenience with which they may reach their place of employment at the Chicago Bridge and Iron Works west of Throop. This industry, by the way, is at present erecting two large new steel buildings. There are many vacant lots throughout the area which is also quite spotted. They have all utilities, pavements, necessary churches and schools. There have been no new assessments for years. They have fair transportation only. Colored people are in that section immediately south of 108th and some Colored families are already located north of 101st to 97th Street between Cenoa and Carpenter. Between May and Aberdeen there are quite a number of two family frames converted and there are a few large apartments north of 101st. Located E. of Vincennes- Sangamon, So. of 96th to 107th. (over) 103rd Street, running east and west, is composed of mixed business and residential properties. One-family homes predominate. There are many very poor homes in the area south of 1103rd, not at all modern and much rehabilitation is necessary throughout all the area, especially painting. In the northern part of the area between 96th and 97th are some new brick homes and 97th to Genoa St., a poor frame house street. Genoa Street itself presents a run-down appearance. On May Street, running south from 99th Street homes are of a better appearance, a mixture of brick and frame bungalows in the $4,000 to $6,000 category. On 107th Street, running west from Halsted is much vacant property turned into truck gardening especially in the south as far as May Street. 107th Street is an exceedingly poor street. And on May Street north of 107th are old frame bungalows of inexpensive construction. Much painting is required and the area south of 103rd can be considered to be inferior to that part of it on the north.","9":{"1":"Washington Heights","2":"D","3":"April 17, 1900","4":"October 25, 1939"}}},"C237":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/C237/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"No","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":""},"b":"Policemen- mechanics- stockyard people- workers- tradesmen- carpenters","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899","p":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"o":{"1":"Good","2":"Good"},"n":{"1":"(1939-Dec.) $30.00-40.00","3":"","4":"(1939-Dec.) $25.00-50.00","5":""},"m":{"1":"$30.00-40.00","2":"","3":"$25.00-50.00","4":""},"l":{"1":"$30.00-40.00","2":"$25.00-50.00"},"k":{"1":"Weak","2":"Weak"},"j":{"1":"Slow","2":"None"},"i":{"2":"(1939-Dec.) $3,000-5,000","3":"","4":"(1939-Dec.) $3,500-8,000","5":""},"h":{"1":"$3,150-5,260","2":"","3":"$3,500-8,000","4":""},"g":{"1":"$3,000-5,000","2":"$3,500-8,000"},"f":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"e":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":"December 31, 1899"},"d":{"1":"Fair","2":"Fair"},"c":{"1":"35 years","2":"35 years"},"b":{"1":"Brick- frame","2":"Brick"},"a":{"1":"Detached singles 5-6 rooms","2":"Two-family detached 5-6 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"January 1, 1900","2":"Singles $7,000-15,000","3":"Built for owners"},"4":{"b":"April 9, 1900","a":"January 1, 1900"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"27; 20 institutions"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is an old district and may be said to be declining due in large measure to the threat of colored encroachment into the area from the north.

However, this is a good neighborhood from a negro standpoint, and may be said to be improving. The eastern extremity is still populated with some white families, but the area will eventually be 100 per cent negro. Shopping facilities are rather poor. Heavy traffic along 95th and State Sts. Area is bounded on east, west and south by high speed thorofares. Neighborhood building and loan associations will lend here at 6 per cent interest- 3 per cent commission on a 60 per cent appraisal on new construction. insurance companies have never loaned in here. Extremely difficult to obtain loans on existing homes.

Prices have stiffened in the past two years since many of the foreclosed properties have been sold off. In 1935 it was next to impossible to get an offer; all were for sale. However, generally, the mortgage plus taxes and interest amounted to more than the value of the buildings, and accordingly there were not many sold until foreclosure caused the redution in price. The area was built about the peak with easy money and liberal financing and small equities. This was speculative construction, and 3 flats originally sold from $25,000 to $26,000. The area becomes less desirable near the railroad, and the best portion on the other hand is along Blackstone, Dante, and Harper.

It is sometimes referred to as the \"Ridge\", which boundaries are approximately from 91st to 119th between the Rock Island Suburban and Western Avenue (the highest point on Cook County is at 111th and Hoyne). In this area of Beverly Hills, approximately 25 per cent of the properties are valued at in excess of $25,000- some of them as high as $75,000 to $100,000. The inhabitants are of high grade and the population stable. Many of the homes here were purchased in the inflation period, and a large proportion are mortgaged. For the most part, lawns, shrubs and trees are quite numerous and there is ample evidence of good up-keep. 95th Street, on the north, is zoned for business. Between 103rd and 107th north to 104th, and a very large apartment building located on the northeast corner of 104th and Wood. There are also some apartments on Claremont (which is zoned for apartments) between 103rd and (over) 107th; and on Longwood Drive on the east, between 108th and 110th. The principal development of this area has occurred since 1900 and, for the most part, was on Longwood Drive and adjacent thereto, between 103rd and 95th. Between 103rd and 107th, on Seeley Avenue, are some old homes of 25 to 30 years of age. Bell, Oakley and Claremont, for about two blocks north of 107th, is a substantial brick bungalow neighborhood. Damen Street north from 101st has a somewhat newer development- then tapers off to the north with an older type cost home. Seeley Street, south of 95th to 99th, is not quite as good as that portion of it from 99th south to 101st. Hoyne, north of 103rd, is a mixture of stucco, frame and brick; quite old for one block and then developing into much better homes as far north as 95th. South of 104th on Claremont are some brick two-flats. North on Bell and Leavitt from 107th is all built up with good, substantial homes. Seeley north of 107th, is somewhat older with several stucco and frame between 105th and 103rd; and Longwood south from 103rd is a mixture of old frame and brick homes located considerably away from the street, almost entirely on the west side. These homes are not so substantial between 106th and 107th. At the northwest corner of 107th and Longwood south from 103rd is a large old home that probably cost around $100,000, which has been converted into a girls' private schools. This apparently was done against the zoning ordinance but is an example of what happens to some of these old homes. There have been approximately 50 to 75 new homes; 6-8 rooms; brick; and in the price category of $10,000-15,000 built in the area during the past year. Thsi new construction has taken place, for the most part, in the western section, to which there is a trend. It is well to bear in mind that there are no restrictions against the sale to negroes of property north of 107th in the area west of Vicennes. To the southeast, between 107th and 115th, there is an extensive colored district which lies between Vicennes and Morgan Street. Beverley Hills area enjoys a good turnover of property, although the market can be said to be a buyer's. It is also believed to have a comparatively small percentage of homes free of encumbrance. The majority of people residing here work in the Loop district of the city. The area enjoys good schools, shopping facilities and transportation; and a high degree of ownership is evident.

There is a fine shopping district at 95th and Bell, developing as a result of this building activity. (Recently, the Atlantic & Pacific Company opened up a large super-market which is open day and night, including Sunday.) Vacancy lots sell approximately from $2,000-3,500.

The majority of lots are 75 and 100 feet in width, ground values are high, averaging $80.00 per front foot. A high degree of pride of home ownership is evident in well-kept lawns, shrubs, etc. It is well timbered. There is little turnover of property, as these old families have no desire to sell and are quite able to hold and live in these old homesteads. The area will be good for many years and is very exclusive. People living here pride themselves as being one of the original families of Beverley Hills. It is retricted to residences and well buffered by the forest preserve on the north, and the Rock Island Suburban to the east. It is interesting to note that many of these old buildings are now being modernized on a big scale. Vacant property has doubled in value since 1935. Ground values are substantially higher than residential values, and will remain at a peak for some time. Well-informed realtors are of the opinion that this area will always remain one of the high-grade districts in Beverley Hills.

On the west side of Vanderpool are some high-grade new brick residences of 2 stories.

In this area there is some new construction interspersed with old brick bungalows and an occasional 3-flat building. Between 107th and 111th west of Rockwell, there is new construction; 2-story bricks, $6,000-6,500, FHA insured, built for speculation and sold. South of 108th to 111th, east of Rockwell, the area is somewhat older with a miscellaneous lot of old frames and low-priced brick bungalows. Due to the cemetery on the west, values in the area will tend to depreciate. West of Western to Rockwell, south of 111th, is a poor section in process of development, with some fair construction. There is a good Roman Catholic church and school in this area, which gives it a possibility of a future better development as far as Rockwell. 111th Place is an old, declining sectino of frame homes. 111th Street is zoned for business, as well as 95th and 119th. In this Southwest Chicago area, that is; that portion of it between 95th and 119th lying between California and Halsted Street, there is too much property set out for future business development. The adjoining properties are one-family home areas, for the most part, and if more of this had been zoned for apartments, it might have been better. The area north of 103rd between Western and California is platted but not developed. on the south side of 107th at Rockwell is a manufacturing insulating plant. The oldest part of this area is from 109th to 113th. Going west on 107th from Western Avenue to Artesian, one block north and south is vacant. Some new brick bungalows are encountered west of Rockwell, and California is more or less vacant. Campbell Street north from 111th has much vacant property with some two and three-story apartments, and a few single brick bungalows which start at 109th- the street here is unpaved. The new construction is on the west side. At 108th on the east, Campbell has poor frame and cheap construction brick bungalows- on the west side, however, the construction of brick bungalows is of a more substantial character. Artesian Street is a poor one- considerable vacant property and a poor class of old brick and frame home. South of 111th is unpaved. Maplewood going south from 107th and 109th, on the west side, is vacant- the east side has some new brick bungalow construction. The street here is unpaved. North on Talman from 109th, there is considerable vacant property on the east side and on the west are brick bungalows of old construction. At 108th new brick bungalows appear, the east side being vacant. On Washtenaw Street, going south from 107th to 108th, vacant property if on the west side and on the east, brick and frame bungalows. At 109th, homes of older construction of mixed frame, brick and stucco with a few two-flats. Mount Greenwood Cemetery lies to the west. On Fairfield Street there is also much vacant property, the cemetery influence to the west undoubtedly is detrimental. On Maplewood south of 111th, there area few two-family flats. Facing Kennedy Memorial Park, the district between 111th and 115th is known as the old Iglehart district, construction being old-style brick and frame homes. On Western between 112th Place and 113th Place, on the east side, is the Washington Adams Smith Home for elderly people- then mostly small frame bungalows. Future trend in this area is unpromising.

In it reside many of the so-called \"elite\" of the Beverly Hills Morgan Park district. It is considerably older than the area lying to the north; frame buildings here run from 35 to 50 years of age and the bricks of more recent construction, 10 to 20 years. As in Beverly Hills, a high degree of ownership exists. The area enjoys fair to good transportation, all utilities are in, assessments paid, schools good. Here is a well-known section of this a well-known, national military academy, the Morgan Park Military Academy, whose buildings are located between 110th Place and 113th between Hoyne and Bell. The northern section of this area, north of 111th, is the older. Turnover of property is approximately the saame as in the Beverley Hills area. This section has always been considered a high-grade one, but the development of Beverley Hills to the north has had the effect of classifying the area as somewhat inferior to Beverley Hills. Age and obsolescence here is showing its effect, but the area is still desirable. There are some homes in here up to $50,000. (over) At present there is under way a movement to restrict the sale of property to colored people in the district between Rock Island Suburban west to Western Avenue, south of 107th. At present, there is a restriction as to sale to colored people west of Vicennes to the Rock Island Suburban, south of 107th. On Bell Avenue, south of 111th, are many old frame and brick homes; and on Hoyne Avenue south of 111th, homes are predominately frame for one block where it enters Lothair, where buildings are large frame and brick, located on large lots, well kept up with shrubs, trees, etc. On the east side of Longwood, north from 111th, are apartments; and on Seeley south from 107th are high-priced, beautiful brick and stone homes, tapering off south of 108th. West on 110th Place, older buildings appea, mixed iwth new bungalows; and 109th is somewhat older, with some new construction. On Drew Street are fine old homes of brick, frame and stucco. Although this area has attained its peak and property sales are in a buyer's market, the area will continue for some time to house a most desirable type of inhabitant. South of 107th, it will be noticed there are few through streets as far south as 119th. Consequently, there are few tourists or sightseers prowling around, and although this may hurt business, it is a favorable feature toward the continuation of the area as a residential one. Lots are reported to be had at from $1,000-1,500, the average width 35 to 40 feet and 125 feet depth, and some bargains can be obtained.","9":{"1":"Morgan Park","2":"B","3":"May 4, 1900","4":"November 1, 1939"}}},"B126":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"B","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/B126/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"b":"Business and Professional","a":{"1":"Yes","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":"","p":{"1":"Static","2":""},"o":{"1":"Good at above","2":""},"n":{"1":"(1939-Nov.) $50.00-70.00","3":"","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"Rent Area","2":"","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"Not a","2":""},"k":{"1":"Static","2":""},"j":{"1":"Fair up to $10,000-12,000","2":""},"i":{"2":"(1939-Nov.) $7,500-15,000","3":"","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$7,500-15,000","2":"","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"$6,250-12,500","2":""},"f":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":""},"e":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":""},"d":{"1":"Good","2":""},"c":{"1":"15 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Brick","2":""},"a":{"1":"Singles; 5-8 rooms","2":""}},"3":{"1":"January 14, 1900","2":"Sgle: 6-8R $9,500-15,000","3":"Owners"},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":""},"6":"Ample, 5%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This area is a fairly recent development; average age of about 15 years; almost entirely a home owner neighborhood. Development started here in approximately 1920. The older homes are on Longwood Drive and there are some homes in the area valued in excess of $50,000. It is some distance from schools, and inquiry here for property is somewhat limietd, although the future outlook is promising. The area is also part of Morgan Park, which was annexed to Chicago in 1914. Transportation is good, and the fact that there are no through streets adds to its desirability as a residential section. Sale of property to colored people west of Vicennes to the Rock Island Suburban is retricted north as far as 107th, and it is expected the same restrictions will be completed soon as far west as Western Avenue and south to 119th. It will be seen, therefore, that the area south of 107th, acts as a buffer to Beverley Hills insofar as sale restrictinos to the colored element are concerned. Longwood Drive on the west side has many beautiful homes set away back from the street, with lawns, shrubbery, trees, etc. There is much vacant property for development to the west of the area to the (over) Baltimore & Ohio freight line. At this point, the Mount Hope Cemetery is encountered. There are many vacant lots south of 115th, and most of the new homes south of 115th have been constructed since 1929. On the eastern side of Bell Street are many fine homes, and between 116th and 118th, vacant prpoerty is set out for school purposes. Bell Street changes abruptly at 119th to homes of cheaper construction. North of 119th on east Oakley are expensive homes and some recent substantial development- vacant land is work approximately $35.00 per foot. A Swedish Home for the Aged is located on Bell Street between 114th and 113th; and north of 113th on Oakley, homes are somewhat older. The larger Barker home is located on 116th west of Longwood. On the east side of Longwood, south of 115th, buildings are not so attractive nor substantial as on the west side. They are mostly brick bungalows, with some frame and stucco, especially between 118th and 119th. The large colored area east of Vicennes, now that restrictions as to sale to colored people are in effect, is not considered as detrimental.

From 115th to 119th there are a few two-unit brick apartments and some 5-room bungalow type buildings about 20 years old.

South of 95th to 97th, and west of Walden to Seeley, is a fairly good residential section of one-family homes; 6-9 rooms and 20-35 years of age. This particular (over) section is part of what was originally known as the Longwood district. The area has all improvements and pavements, good transportation, easy access to schools and parks. There are old frames on Walden Parkway near 103rd. On Longwood Drive north of 103rd are large old brick homes on the west side, frame being in the majority on the east side. North of 99th, frames predominte on both sides of Longwood. This is approximately where the original development occurred. South of 96th is a large field house, swimming pool, etc., under the control of the Chicago Park Board. South of 95th on Winchester are old frame and stucco singles. These extend for two blocks, where a better quality of home develops. South of 95th and Seeley is a large apartment building. North of 119th on Hale is a cheap brick bungalow area on narrow lots.

East of Prospect Avenue to Church Street, and north of 107th to 103rd, properties are of a modest brick and frame bungalow type. Immediately north of 103rd, east of Prospet, is a large public park and field house. North of 107th on Wood Street, homes are mostly old stucco, brick and frame, with a number of small brick bungalows. Between 104th Place and Wood is a large apartment building. North of 103rd, properties feather out into an inferior grade, interspersed with some substantial (over) homes. North of 99th on Vanderpool are many old frame and stucco homes as far north as 95th. There is a good business section at 95th and Hale, extending east to Prospect, in which are some old mixed frame and brick stucco homes requiring painting. Prospect is a fair street, although it becomes somewhat better south of 100th to 103rd, thence for a block south on the east side are poor frames. Church and Charles Streets have a variety of mixed old frame and brick bungalows, as well as some stucco. The area is in a static state and likely to deteriorate somewhat rapidly due to age, and is quite spotted as to size, construction and value of homes.","9":{"1":"Southwest Chicago","2":"C","3":"September 10, 1900","4":"November 1, 1939"}}},"D106":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"D","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/D106/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"December 30, 1899","c":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"December 30, 1899"},"b":"Laborer- low-class wage earner","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":"","p":{"1":"","2":""},"o":{"1":"","2":""},"n":{"1":"Area","3":"","4":"","5":""},"m":{"1":"Rent","2":"","3":"","4":""},"l":{"1":"Not a","2":""},"k":{"1":"Down","2":""},"j":{"1":"Poor","2":""},"i":{"2":"(1939-Nov.) $2,500-4,500","3":"","4":"","5":""},"h":{"1":"$2,500-4,500","2":"","3":"","4":""},"g":{"1":"$2,500-4,500","2":""},"f":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":""},"e":{"1":"December 31, 1899","2":""},"d":{"1":"Poor","2":""},"c":{"1":"45-50 years","2":""},"b":{"1":"Frame","2":""},"a":{"1":"Single; 5-7 rooms","2":""}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":"December 30, 1899"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"December 30, 1899"},"6":"Limited 5 1/2-6%","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This narrow area, extending osuth from 95th lying on the west side of Pennsylvania freight line as far as 103rd and on the west side of Rock Island (Main Line) from 103rd to 107th, is a deteriorating area which acts as a buffer between these railroads and the area adjacent to the west.

The town has no zoning ordinance, the only reason why it should grow is from the overflow from the city of Chicago, immediately to the north. This area is practically all built up. There are very few homes for sale. It is very spotted, and the town itself is no attraction for anybody who desires anything better. There are no homes over $10,000 in the entire town. There are railroads all over the place, and much noise and smoke. The Chicago anad Eastern Railroad removed their yards about ten years ago from Dolton to Danville, Illinois. At that time they employed about 1,400 men, and they used to work 42 engines in the yards. Now the number of employes is between 60 and 70.

This so-called Albany Park section has been Jewish, however, for a period of about ten to fifteen years, but the better families during the past three to five years have been moving into the Rogers Park section, and Albany Park is feeling the infiltration of somewhat lower class Jewish families from Southwest Chicago. There is a sizeable overhang in the area, and a slight tendency on the part of institutions to dump properties, although no wholesale instance of this has occurred as yet. Lawrence and Kedzie are the main shopping streets, but many of the stores are typical fish markets and shoe-string business operations. One reason for the good rentals obtainable is because of excellent elevated transportation ending at Lawrence and Kimball. The higher-priced rentals quoted above in most cases have one and one-half baths. The experience of many institutions in the area is that tenants move very often and considerable reconditioning must be done at least one a year. The grading of the area is penalized because of the class of occupancy, and a very marked downward trend.","9":{"1":"Albany Park","2":"3rd","3":"C-55","4":""}}},"C56":{"ad_id":45,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/IL/Chicago/1940/C56/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"None","d":"0%","c":{"1":"20%","2":"Mixture"},"b":"Lower middle class","a":{"1":"","2":"","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"75%","2":"20%","i":{"2":"(1939) $2,500-6,000","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"(1939) $6,000-8,500","5":"December 30, 1899"},"h":{"1":"$2,500-6,000","2":"13+","3":"$6,000-8,500","4":"9+"},"g":{"1":"$2,250-5,250","2":"$5,500-7,750"},"f":{"1":"65%","2":""},"e":{"1":"99%","2":"97%"},"d":{"1":"Fair- few poor","2":"Fair"},"c":{"1":"35 years","2":"35 years"},"b":{"1":"Frame- few stucco","2":"Brick"},"a":{"1":"One-family; 5-7 rooms","2":"Two-family; 5-6 rooms"},"p":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"o":{"1":"Good- up to $35.00","2":"Good- up to $50.00"},"n":{"1":"(1939) $20.00-45.00","3":"December 30, 1899","4":"(1939) $40.00-55.00","5":"December 30, 1899"},"m":{"1":"$20.00-45.00","2":"12+","3":"$40.00-55.00","4":"16+"},"l":{"1":"$18.00-40.00","2":"$35.00-47.50"},"k":{"1":"Firm","2":"Firm"},"j":{"1":"Fair- up to $4,500","2":"Fair- up to $7,000"}},"3":{"1":"December 30, 1899","2":"","3":""},"4":{"b":"","a":""},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"January 5, 1900"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"","2":""},"8":"This is a mediocre neighborhood of old frame houses with a few scattered brick two-family units some of which have stone fronts.
