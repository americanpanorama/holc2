Its proximity to the Navy Yard affords opportunity for employment and results in a good rental demand. The area has all city facilities and boasts its own Fire Department.

The waterfront is desirable and Lafayette Park is adjacent to the south. Granby St. at the western boundary is a thoroughfare to Ocean View, but there is little traffic through the area. Three small apartment buildings having three to five room suites, rent for from about $40 to $50 per unit per month. In common with the majority of neighborhoods east of Granby Street, lack of demand is reported in this area because it is not in the direction of the city's growth. Age and obsolescence indicate that the area has reached its peak and is unworthy of a better classification than that of medium desirability.","9":{"1":"Riverview (Norfolk)","2":"Low 2nd","3":"B-10","4":"Nov. 1939"}}},"C10":{"ad_id":166,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/VA/Norfolk/1940/","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"none","d":"0%","c":{"1":"0%","2":"N/A"},"b":"Municipal employees - Navy people - clerks, $2,000","a":{"1":"N/A","2":"N/A","3":"Yes"}},"2":{"1":"65%","2":"25%","m":{"1":"25 to 40","2":"0%","3":"22.5 to 37.5","4":"0.09"},"l":{"1":"25 to 40","2":"20 to 35"},"k":{"1":"firm","2":"firm"},"j":{"1":"fair","2":"fair"},"i":{"1":"1939","2":"2000 to 4000","3":"0.04","4":"2500 to 5000","5":"0%"},"h":{"1":"2000 to 3750","2":"0.08","3":"2500 to 5000","4":"0%"},"g":{"1":"1800 to 3500","2":"2500 to 5000"},"f":{"1":"50%","2":"50%"},"e":{"1":"95%","2":"97%"},"d":{"1":"fair","2":"fair"},"c":{"1":"25 years","2":"25 years"},"b":{"1":"frame - some brick","2":"frame - some brick"},"a":{"1":"1-family 2 story, 6-8 rooms","2":"2-4 family, 5-6 room conversions"},"p":{"1":"firm","2":"firm"},"o":{"1":"good","2":"good"},"n":{"1":"1939","2":"25 to 40","3":"0%","4":"25 to 40","5":"0.08"}},"3":{"1":"5","2":"1-2 family, $3,500-5,000","3":"built to order"},"4":{"b":"75","a":"15 - $68,400"},"5":{"1":"4","b":"50","a":"11 - $43,000"},"6":"limited","7":{"1":"9","2":"$25.00"},"8":"One of the older residential sections of Norfolk, approximately 90% built up with old fashioned houses on narrow lots and therefore more or less congested.

While Belvedere has a very desirable appearance, it is unworthy of the best classification for the reason that most of the houses have been built with very low foundations with insufficient ventilation to dry out foundation timbers, which gives rise to possible difficulties from dampness and termites. The resulting sales resistance has caused the developers to offer the houses either for sale or for rent furnished or unfurnished and this has attracted such people as those temporarily attached to the Naval Operating Base and other transient families, so that the population is comparatively unstable. A somewhat better class of construction prevails in Cromwell and Ellsworth. The development is well planned, parklike in appearance and attractively landscaped. Most streets are winding and there are few sidewalks. The streets are poorly lighted, a fault common in all Norfolk neighborhoods. No sewers have been installed, but the area has all other city facilities. Lots are ample in size, many being 75 by 150 feet, and the waterfront sites are the most desirable.

Co. plant to the west, the encroachment of business and industry (including railroad tracks) and a large steel scrap yard to the east. About 10% of the structures are apartment hosues built during the World War and now renting for from $5.00 to $12.00 per room per month. The area bounded by 25th and 35th Streets from Washington to West Street is an older section of Newport News, still inhabited by substantial old families. The large frame and brick houses are closely built and would be difficult to sell, but this part of the area is better than the average. Elsewhere a number of old houses have been converted and are now used as boarding houses for which there is a good rental demand because of the close in location and convenience to employment at the shipyard and railroad terminal. Land values in the area were seriously affected in 1937 when the Old Dominion Land Co. liquidated and exchanged property for outstanding securities. Streets are well paved, schools, churches, neighborhood stores convenient.

Since the security area map was limited in size, only Rivermont and a section of Hilton are shown on the map. Hilton Village was developed during the World War by the U.S. Housing Corportation and was later sold in one trade to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company who subsequently marketed this group of about 200 small homes, to individual owners. This particular group of homes in Hilton Village would probably now fall in the $3,500-$4,500 class and while because of age they would not classify as first grade, they have been beneficially influenced by good maintenance, pride of ownership, and character of the surrounding developments. THe newer construction is sound, well-planned, and has attracted a good middle and upper middle class of people. Morrison is also an established community. Other developments mentioned are of more recent origin. The construction is sound, well planned and attractive. The terrain is slightly rolling in some places but generally level. Brick and frame houses are well spaced and some are on very large lots. There is no important concentration of new houses in one place but construction is preceding slowly throughout the area and it is attracting the executives and business men of Newport News. On the whole this is an area occupied by people in a higher income group than those now being attracted to the Wythe and Indian River Section of Elizabeth City County (Area A-4).","9":{"1":"Warwick County","2":"1st","3":"A-5","4":"Jan. 1940"}}}}
