Originally developed in 1920 as an ultra-exclusive district, separate from Akron, this area was named the Village of Fairlawn. However, the severity of the 1930 decline in home construction in this rapidly developed area, due to its very exclusiveness and unwarranted size, caused the promoters to petition for annexation. This was approved by the City of Akron in 1932. The main part, containing the most beautiful and expensive homes ( a few cost as high at $70,000) lies south of the Akron-Medina Road on an artistically landscaped, heavily wooded plateau. (Since plateau rises approximately 100 feet above the A.C. Y. railroad at south end, there is little if any influence by this usual detriment.) The lots average 70 foot frontage and are traversed by excellent winding streets (70% in area paved). The area is now built up 35% -- formerly, the minimum improvement restriction was $15,000 but now has been reduced to $12,500. Six homes from $14,000 up were built in area last year. Due to the city's weak financial condition, installation of utilities has been slow and has delayed development of area. However, all utilities now have been installed except gas and electricity in 50% of area (mostly undeveloped).

Later development and installation of utilities brought the building of better type homes. The subject area surrounds the short business district of Kenmore which lies on Kenmore Boulevard between 11th and 18th streets. The average lot frontage is 40 feet; built up 50%; transportation fair to limited; schools, churches and stores convenient only to southern and eastern parts of area. The best homes and most desirable section of the area lie in that part east of 13th Street between Indian Trail and Montana – Viewland Avenues. This section, situation on a plateau and known as Overlook Allotment, was platted into a first-class residential district of 50-foot front lots – is now 75% built up and will improve. However, general outlook for balance of area if only fair and little hope exists for improvement of central western part due to cheapness of homes and low locality.","9":{"1":"Formerly Kenmore, Akron, Ohio","2":"B","3":"11","4":"Feb '39"}}},"C19":{"ad_id":114,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Akron/1939/C19/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"","d":"0","c":{"1":"5","2":"Mixed"},"b":"Laborers - factory workers","a":{"1":"Slightly","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"65","2":"35","p":{"1":"Static","2":"Static"},"o":{"1":"Good","2":"Good"},"n":{"1":"Jan '39","2":"9-15","3":"-8","4":"16-35","5":"-9"},"m":{"1":"9-17","2":"18","3":"16-40","4":"19"},"l":{"1":"8-14","2":"15-32"},"k":{"1":"Static","2":"Static"},"j":{"1":"Slow","2":"Slow"},"i":{"1":"Jan '39","2":"1000-2200","3":"-8","4":"2100-4500","5":"-8"},"h":{"1":"1100-2400","2":"17","3":"2200-5000","4":"16"},"g":{"1":"1000-2000","2":"2000-4200"},"f":{"1":"65%","2":"65%"},"e":{"1":"95%","2":"65%"},"d":{"1":"Fair","2":"Fair"},"c":{"1":"15 yrs.","2":"15 yrs."},"b":{"1":"Frame","2":"Frame"},"a":{"1":"Small cottages and bungalows 4 rooms","2":"2 story single family 6 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"20","2":"$2250","3":"Slow"},"4":{"b":"","a":"8, 3-31-39"},"5":{"1":"","b":"","a":"4, 3-31-39"},"6":"Limited","7":{"1":"8","2":"28.90"},"8":"This is one of the newer districts developed about 1920.

Reasonable distance to schools, churches; homes range from $600-3500. 95% of homes are of single construction. Lack of attention to the regularity of buildings constructed in this area is the chief deterrent to growth. Interspersed with a sprinkling of shacks (20%). This allotment has no restrictions. Hourly bus transportation. Very heavy vehicular traffic along West Tallmadge Avenue. Will probably remain “as is” for some time. In certain portions it is difficult to excavate basements because of sandstone rock foundation. Elevation of this area is one of the highest in Akron, but still subject to noise, smoke and dirt from adjacent Baltimore and Ohio and Erie railroads due to prevailing northeast winds from the valley.","9":{"1":"Akron, Ohio","2":"C","3":"9","4":"Feb '39"}}},"C6":{"ad_id":114,"name":null,"holc_grade":"C","sheets":1,"url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/holc/ads/OH/Akron/1939/C6/{z}/{x}_{y}.png","areaDesc":{"1":{"e":"Very light foreign infiltration","d":"0","c":{"1":"5","2":"Italian"},"b":"Rubber workers and laborers","a":{"1":"Slightly","2":"","3":""}},"2":{"1":"60","2":"40","p":{"1":"Static","2":"Static"},"o":{"1":"Good","2":"Good"},"n":{"1":"Jan '39","2":"9/16/2016","3":"-10","4":"10-21.00","5":"-10"},"m":{"1":"10-18","2":"22","3":"12-22.50","4":"23"},"l":{"1":"8-15","2":"10-18"},"k":{"1":"Static","2":"Static"},"j":{"1":"Fair","2":"Fair"},"i":{"1":"Jan '39","2":"1000-2000","3":"-12","4":"1500-2500","5":"-11"},"h":{"1":"1200-2200","2":"22","3":"1700-2750","4":"19"},"g":{"1":"1000-1800","2":"10-18"},"f":{"1":"60%","2":"60%"},"e":{"1":"97%","2":"97%"},"d":{"1":"Fair only","2":"Fair only"},"c":{"1":"15 yrs.","2":"15 yrs."},"b":{"1":"Frame","2":"Frame"},"a":{"1":"Small story single family and cottages","2":"2 story single family 6 rooms"}},"3":{"1":"10","2":"$1500","3":"Fair"},"4":{"b":"","a":"6, 3-31-39"},"5":{"1":"","a":"1, 3-31-39","b":""},"6":"Very little available","7":{"1":"8","2":"28.90"},"8":"Area was laid out 1910; price range of homes $1000-2500.

The newest section of this area, lying east of Stow Road contains the better homes ranging from $5000-6000. The part of this area west of Nottingham Street is the cheaper new section and consists mostly of homes values at $1500. North of Woodward Avenue, this area is sparsely built up. Overdale and Overlook Avenues are paved; remainder of streets cindered; generally all utilities except gas. Good school facilities, close to business section of Tallmadge. Trend is static with possibility of improvement. 75% of homes are of single construction; the houses located east of Stow and North of Kent Roads are of double construction. Property, if acquired, should not be sacrificed.","9":{"1":"Tallmadge, Akron, Ohio","2":"C","3":"7","4":"Feb '39"}}}}
