Its period of more rapid development was between the years 1915 and 1925. The area suffered considerably during the depression years and approximately 136 HOLC loans totaling $446,000 were placed in the district, which is the largest HOLC investment in any area in the city. In recent years the development has been largely in the southeastern part along Peacock Lane, Couch St., Oak St., 44th and 45th Avenues.
